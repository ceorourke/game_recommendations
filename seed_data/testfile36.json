The player controls the protagonist Tim as he runs, jumps, and climbs across the game's levels. Tim jumps and stomps on enemies to defeat them, and can collect keys to unlock doors or operate levers to trigger platforms. A defining game element is the player's unlimited ability to reverse time and \"rewind\" actions, even after dying. The game is divided into six worlds, which are experienced sequentially and can be entered from different rooms of Tim's house; the player can return to any world previously visited to attempt to solve puzzles they missed.", "storyline": "Tim is a man searching for a princess who \"has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster.\"His relationship with this princess is vague at best, and the only clear part of this relationship is that Tim has made some sort of mistake which he hopes to reconcile or, if possible, erase. As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid, storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim's quest for the princess, and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration. The final level, in which everything but Tim moves in reverse, depicts the princess escaping from a knight, and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home. Tim is suddenly locked out of the house, and, as time progresses forward, reversing Tim's actions, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight. Tim is revealed to be the \"monster\" the princess is running from. \nFollowing completion of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb\u2014\"Now we are all sons of bitches\"\u2014is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development.[20] Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braid's plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as \"You must look back to go forwards\" as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he \"would not be capable\" of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is \"something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly.\"Blow considered Braid to be \"about the journey, not the destination\". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide \"a longer-term challenge\".", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hlgubb2qmioujlw2alq6.jpg", "width": 940, "cloudinary_id": "hlgubb2qmioujlw2alq6", "height": 529}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xyzfrllx4iqggitmmil1.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "xyzfrllx4iqggitmmil1", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gm2hmeizg03ohzgjlqhp.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "gm2hmeizg03ohzgjlqhp", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lvr4kfokntgawqvkfsqi.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "lvr4kfokntgawqvkfsqi", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oqxrufwqwvaqjohlhomw.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "oqxrufwqwvaqjohlhomw", "height": 720}], "id": 2853}, {"genres": [8, 31], "name": "DuckTales: Remastered", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/acnhjsbnx95apaoslki5.jpg", "width": 1053, "cloudinary_id": "acnhjsbnx95apaoslki5", "height": 1500}, "summary": "DuckTales Remastered takes the classic Disney platforming adventure to a whole new level.

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. \n \nScattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. \n \nThe game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress. \n \nAt the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues). \n \nWhen Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a \"Secret Zone\" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nf1iu9lmtr4nzdz2a2mh.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "nf1iu9lmtr4nzdz2a2mh", "height": 270}], "id": 3192}, {"genres": [31, 32, 33], "name": "The Maw", "videos": [{"video_id": "-KJbUeXmEq8", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x4xtfwawlanqjxi09sse.jpg", "width": 219, "cloudinary_id": "x4xtfwawlanqjxi09sse", "height": 300}, "summary": "In The Maw players control Frank, who in turn controls The Maw via an electrical leash that he uses keep him at his side.

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. \nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. \nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frj7es6ak4g6if4bs3df.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "frj7es6ak4g6if4bs3df", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gho1yattixqth0skvueo.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "gho1yattixqth0skvueo", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d5ovnsnje55odia1mjtq.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "d5ovnsnje55odia1mjtq", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j7bg8nax9azvoizhildo.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "j7bg8nax9azvoizhildo", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qmtdiyyqcolrhpjumx9t.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "qmtdiyyqcolrhpjumx9t", "height": 272}], "id": 4689}, {"genres": [9], "name": "Lumines Live!", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ybnz5rzzkavrot97wwpl.jpg", "width": 219, "cloudinary_id": "ybnz5rzzkavrot97wwpl", "height": 300}, "summary": "Frenetic puzzle action!

In addition to the main plot, the game contains a subplot conducted via calls received on Kate's cell phone. It involves Kate's deteriorating relationship with her fianc\u00e9.", "storyline": "In the game, the player controls the actions of American lawyer Kate Walker, who is sent to a remote French village in order to finalize the take-over of a toy factory. Once at the village, Kate learns that the woman who owned the factory has just died, and she has a brother who must be contacted in order for the takeover to proceed. Her mission takes her across Central and Eastern Europe, which gradually leads her to question her own life. The titular Syberia is a mythical island on which mammoths are said to live. \n \nThe game starts with Kate arriving in the fictional French village of Valadil\u00e8ne and witnessing the funeral of Anna Voralberg, the owner of a family-owned spring-automaton toy factory. When Kate visits the village notary to finalize the deal, the notary tells her that just before Anna's death, the old lady revealed that her brother is not dead and buried, but alive somewhere in the North-East. Now that his sister is dead, Hans Voralberg becomes the new owner of the factory, which cannot be sold without his approval. Kate has no choice: If she wants the takeover to succeed, she will have to find Hans. Kate's research reveals that Hans was injured in his attempt to retrieve a prehistoric doll of a man riding a mammoth. It stunted his development, leaving him mentally handicapped, and Hans' sole goal became to find mammoths to ride as the doll depicts. \n \nIn order to find Hans, Kate must take his train: a clockwork locomotive built by his sister at his request. It is manned by Oscar, an animatronic man fond of protocol whom Kate must satisfy to depart. She is forced to dive into Hans' past to retrieve two items of value to him: the mammoth doll and a clockwork music box. \n \nAs she follows Hans' path, Kate makes her way to Barrockstadt, a failing university whose train station acts as a botanical garden. The train stops short of the winding mechanism so Kate must barter with a nearby couple with a barge. They insist on being paid $100 for their assistance, so Kate has to fix the university's broken bandstand to get the university's stubborn board of directors to help. Along the way, she gets a lesson on the legend of Syberia and the customs of the mysterious prehistoric Youkol people who lived with mammoths and were able to domesticate them. Before she can leave Barrockstadt entirely, she must pass the large wall that keeps her train from exiting. \n \nThe next stop is Komkolzgrad, a dusty Communist-era industrial mining complex with two giant metallic worker-automata overlooking the tracks. The place is run by the eccentric and somewhat crazy Serguei Borodine, who steals Oscar's hands to make his automaton organist work. He intends to construct the biggest stage possible for Helena Romanski, a washed-up opera singer with whom he is obsessed. Kate has little choice but to fetch her from a nearby spa in Aralbad on his behalf. Serguei directs Kate to the adjacent cosmodrome for transportation. \n \nAt the cosmodrome, Kate meets former test pilot Boris, a drunk who dreams of flying into space on a \"flying wing\" invented by Hans. After some sobering up, he teaches Kate how to operate an old airship in exchange for her help in making the flying wing functional. He also warns Kate not to trust Serguei. Once Boris is launched, she uses his advice to launch the airship and leaves for Aralbad. \n \nAt the Aralbad spa, Kate meets Helena after getting past the manager. The elderly lady believes she is too old to sing, having lost her legendary voice, which could break glass. With a special cocktail mixed at the bar and a wine glass, Kate convinces Helena that she can still sing. Helena agrees to go with Kate. \n \nThe performance in Komkolzgrad does not go quite as planned: beautiful though Helena's voice may be (she sings \"Dark Eyes\"), it doesn't stop Serguei from imprisoning her, as he wants to keep Helena at his side as his personal opera singer. Kate is able to free Helena and take back Oscar's hands, but Serguei isn't quite willing to give up without a fight, using the worker-automata to block the train. Some spare dynamite dispatches that problem, and Kate brings Helena back to Aralbad.

Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via \"skyways\" that propel him through the air. \n \nDuring his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (\"Mancers\") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well. \n \nTo repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion. \n \nAfter the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcccbp6huxz4ea2mn5md.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "bcccbp6huxz4ea2mn5md", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dutrfep6budmbhqjva27.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "dutrfep6budmbhqjva27", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/peydgf7t6il73ad6actd.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "peydgf7t6il73ad6actd", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqv2ubfkqsji4kz9oyxa.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "dqv2ubfkqsji4kz9oyxa", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xsl6film2bhrgdtimpkn.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "xsl6film2bhrgdtimpkn", "height": 1080}], "id": 1983}, {"genres": [9, 31, 32], "name": "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons", "videos": [{"video_id": "DHohBVfhGDU", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "uPcPDFSLC2M", "name": "Teaser"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wl4ubgldu8jjxmoqv8vs.jpg", "width": 584, "cloudinary_id": "wl4ubgldu8jjxmoqv8vs", "height": 698}, "summary": "Brothers is presented from a third-person view overlooking the two brothers.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years. \nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma. \nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement. \nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before. \nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch. \nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place. \nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer. \nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "hbpppia7u4cytseppaea", "height": 1080}], "id": 2602}, {"genres": [4, 32], "name": "One Finger Death Punch", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/us20fdb88of0z86zwtnx.jpg", "width": 584, "cloudinary_id": "us20fdb88of0z86zwtnx", "height": 700}, "summary": "Experience cinematic kung-fu battles in the fastest, most intense brawler the indie world has ever seen!

Enemies can, however, move in any direction, and auto-aim is utilized to allow the player to fire at nearby enemies or objects both inside and outside of the 2D plane. The player can use the right control stick to aim with a laser sight. Gameplay in Shadow Complex was inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The gameplay takes many cues from Metroid: the player can move freely throughout the expansive game world, defeating enemies with a variety of weapons, and as they overcome challenges, they gain new abilities and weapons which allow them to reach new areas.\nThe game rewards the player with experience points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic attributes of the character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels.

One Dead Echo team, led by Grayson Hunt (Steven Blum), having been following Sarrano's orders in assassinating what they believe are drug traffickers and mass murderers, kill a man known as Bryce Novak, but soon discover he was a civilian reporter, having documented other civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo. Grayson and his team realize they have been duped by Sarrano and go AWOL, becoming space pirates on the run from Sarrano's forces, now going by the name Final Echo.\n\nTen years later, Grayson's team tries to flee from Sarrano's battlecruiser, the Ulysses, while near the planet of Stygia. With their ship's systems failing, Grayson, in a drunken stupor, orders the crew to ram at the Ulysses, hoping to gain revenge on Sarraro. The ships collide, forcing both down and causing them to crash land on the surface of Stygia. One of Grayson's men, Ishi Sato (Andrew Kishino), is critically wounded in the crash and Grayson is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ship's medical equipment. On the planet, a former popular tropical-like resort destination, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. Grayson fights through to one of the Ulysses escape pods, where a Final Echo soldier succumbs to a horde of mutants. After dispatching the attackers, Grayson retrieves the escape pod's energy cell, as well as an \"instinct leash\" that, when worn, begins to provide him strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills.\n\nGrayson returns with the cell, and while Ishi is under operation, the mutants attack their ship. The operation is cut short by an explosion during battle, leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg. Grayson and Ishi, the only survivors, decide to work together to get off the planet, despite Ishi's disapproval of Grayson's thirst for revenge. The instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod, where they find Trishka (Jennifer Hale), another Final Echo soldier who agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi, but only after they rescue Sarrano. As they battle through the ravaged city, Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a sort of training grounds, with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test; those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive. When Grayson learns that Trishka was Novak's daughter, he tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her father's death, but claims he does not know who actually killed him.\n\nThe three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Sarrano's pod landed. Trishka accuses Sarrano of her father's death, but he simply kicks her off the side of the building. Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi that there is an armed DNA bomb on the Ulysses that will wipe out all life on the planet, and that they must go and disarm it, as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. Sarrano leads them through the underground areas of the city, encountering radioactive waste and a giant prison. Sarrano snidely explains that that shields used to protect the planet's surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste, and in turn, began to mutate the population of the surface; the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued, and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians. Grayson is furious at this revelation, but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses. Aboard, Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi once again, having them actually arm the DNA bomb, while his rescue ship will arrive in time to save him. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by Trishka, who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down.\n\nThe three race to where Sarrano's rescue ship is landing and manage to get on board. They make their way through Sarrano's elite troops and eventually face Sarrano alone. Trishka demands to know who actually killed her father, to which Sarrano indicts Grayson. In the confusion, Sarrano hijack's Ishi's computer systems, forcing him to turn on his friends. Grayson manages to break Sarrano's control of Ishi, and Ishi sacrifices himself to prevent Sarrano from killing Grayson. Grayson then impales Sarrano on the wall of a ship. As Grayson and Trishka regroup, Sarrano performs one final act, ejecting Grayson, Trishka and several of his men from the ship back onto the planet. With the DNA bomb soon to detonate, Grayson and Trishka race back to the Ulysses where one escape pod remains unlaunched; they are able to board it and escape into low orbit, out of range of the DNA bomb when it goes off.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o0zld9tgyhzbm0oimvog.jpg", "width": 1500, "cloudinary_id": "o0zld9tgyhzbm0oimvog", "height": 844}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vhdsfal6zia0ayfs6cwz.jpg", "width": 1500, "cloudinary_id": "vhdsfal6zia0ayfs6cwz", "height": 844}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iviwqpikmohnbx7tz8gk.jpg", "width": 1500, "cloudinary_id": "iviwqpikmohnbx7tz8gk", "height": 844}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ceg9dtjxurvo1v2tqcmj.jpg", "width": 1500, "cloudinary_id": "ceg9dtjxurvo1v2tqcmj", "height": 844}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fav5sx9ghxu6kw5dk4ir.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "fav5sx9ghxu6kw5dk4ir", "height": 1080}], "id": 494}, {"genres": [8, 31], "name": "Enslaved: Odyssey to the West", "videos": [{"video_id": "ZpBfMIVmHbE", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qoeibu4f3hjoegoedrhe.jpg", "width": 888, "cloudinary_id": "qoeibu4f3hjoegoedrhe", "height": 931}, "summary": "Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an action-adventure platform video game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Namco Bandai Games.

Controls are simple, with the game largely consisting of running, jumping and punching. Levels are made up of various types of blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes, and also feature hazards such as water and deadly creatures. \nThe main mode in the game is Adventure Mode, which can be played solo or co-operatively with a second player. During co-operative play, players are able to work together to overcome obstacles, which includes throwing them across gaps, using their heads as platforms and helping each other up ledges, although there is just as much opportunity to sabotage your partner. Adventure mode consists of various worlds each with a set of levels. In order to progress to the next world, players need to collect gems which can also be used to unlock new customiseable parts. Players can also collect balls of yarn which they can use to bribe cat guards and unlock new weapons, such as frisbees and vacuum cleaners. Collecting all gems and the yarn will get you an A++ in the level and two extra gems. Arena mode is a competitive mode for up to four players, which can be played free-for-all or in teams. There are several match types including: \nSoul: Steal enemy soul and run away. Capture and hold the enemy's souls to gain points. Kill a soul-carrier to release their souls to roam the level. \nMuckle: Beat and kill the enemy team to earn your team points. \nChallenge: Score the best time on a given level. \nKing Of The Hill: Stand on the crown blocks to gain your team points. \nColor The World: Color more blocks than the other team. \nGrab The Gold: Grab more gold from the golden whale than the other team and deposit it in the flying safe to score points for your team \nBall Game: Get the ball in the basket. \nHorse: Ride the opposing team's horse to your stables to gain points for your team. \nAlong with a Time Attack mode, the game also features a Level Editor, which allows players to create their own stages for any game type. These levels can be assembled into a playlist, consisting of various Adventure and Arena levels, and uploaded to the community for others to download. There is also additional content unlocked for players who also own Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid HD.[3][4]", "storyline": "Almost all of the game's cut-scenes are done in a stick puppet style. The game begins with the narrator (played by Will Stamper) telling the adventures of the hundreds of friends aboard the S.S. Friendship, as well as Hatty Hattington, who is known as \"best friend to one and all\". After encountering a heavy storm, the S.S. Friendship becomes shipwrecked on a mysterious, seemingly abandoned island, and the crew itself vanishes. Upon waking up from the wreck, the player character seeks shelter from the storm in a dilapidated theater. Soon afterwards, the player discovers technologically advanced, highly-evolved cats restraining a captive Hatty as he is being fitted with an ominously glowing top hat. The hat appears to change him, and he alerts the cats to the player's presence, attacking them and rendering them unconscious. \nUpon coming to, it is revealed that the entire crew of the S.S. Friendship is being held prisoner by the cats, with Hatty as their apparent new leader. The player is then released from their cell and forced into deadly games by the feline wardens. The cats, who force their prisoners into deadly theater performances, watch with amusement as the player fights for their survival. As the player completes challenges, they find gems which are spend on unlocking fellow crew members to play as in these theater performances. Appearing to be possessed by the hat's unknown powers, Hatty begins working for the cats and against the player. \nAs the player progresses, the narrator reveals more about the theater. Hundreds of years before the player shipwrecked on the island, Purrham Furbottom, a theatrical aficionado, sought to build the world's greatest theater. The opening night saw the most jaw-dropping feats and thrills the likes of which were never seen before, making the theater an overnight success. However, Furbottom did not allow intermissions in the theater, and after an untold amount of time watching the show, he died after \"pooping himself to death on the way to the bathroom.\" Since then, his top hat has been passed down to various others, who were each revered by the cats as their leader, and who each met with grim fates of their own. The hat, the narrator theorizes, is haunted by the grief and sorrow of each of its past wearers, and Hatty is its current victim, having sunk into a depression while being surrounded by the many gems the player has accrued, without doing anything to help the state of the theater. \nEventually, the cats grow tired of Hatty's inaction, and begin rioting, striking, and more, while the player's challenges grow increasingly difficult. As the theater deteriorates further, the narrator provides encouragement to the player, and continues to shed light on the cats' mental state, which grows more unstable as time progresses. The narrator also instructs the player to enter The Vault, which houses Hatty and all the gems the player has spent, before the cats kill Hatty and the rest of the crew, starting the madness over again. \nAfter completing the final set of challenges inside the Vault, the player breaks into Hatty's throne room. Hatty doesn't budge, so the player carries him out of the crumbling theater as the crew of the S.S. Friendship orchestrates a mass breakout. Everyone manages to make it back to the boat amidst the chaos, escaping the island and the cats that reside there. As the player celebrates with hot cocoa, he tries to cheer up Hatty, who the narrator implies has sunk into a catatonic state from prolonged exposure to the hat. The narrator sings a sad song as the credits roll, before quickly recovering and singing a more happy, upbeat song, rocking the boat and flinging Hatty into the sea, where he sinks to the bottom. The hat lands on his head and begins glowing green as opposed to its usual red, and shoots a beam skyward, where it sends the boat flying and continues into space, where it vaporizes a bear that appeared during the narrator's upbeat song. The narrator claims to understand what just happened, but does not explain, sending the game back to the title screen.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d60y2bfxrfrxbxiyeyxj.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "d60y2bfxrfrxbxiyeyxj", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/edtzw5ddlu78xut1bxip.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "edtzw5ddlu78xut1bxip", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cin95yxe1odusrimpgc8.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "cin95yxe1odusrimpgc8", "height": 562}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/javfeue3fqfzvztextxd.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "javfeue3fqfzvztextxd", "height": 562}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c1glrjlu56dcek6baxut.jpg", "width": 450, "cloudinary_id": "c1glrjlu56dcek6baxut", "height": 260}], "id": 2605}, {"genres": [8, 9], "name": "Exit 2", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fnamgnxhqwzvmflecpl3.jpg", "width": 219, "cloudinary_id": "fnamgnxhqwzvmflecpl3", "height": 300}, "summary": "Exit 2 is the sequel to the PlayStation Portable game Exit.

Spelunky is one of the first examples of a roguelike-like, borrowing concepts from the roguelike genre, and was the influence for many later roguelike-like games.", "storyline": "Players control an unnamed adventurer, known as the spelunker. The aim of the game is to explore underground tunnels, gathering as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps and enemies. The spelunker can whip or jump on enemies to defeat them, pick up items that can be thrown to either attack enemies or set off traps, and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to navigate the caves. Levels are randomly generated and grouped into four increasingly difficult \"areas\", each with a distinctive set of items, enemies, terrain types and special features. Later areas contain better treasures, secret locations, and items. However, if the player loses all their hearts or runs into an instant kill trap, they will have to start from the beginning. \n \n \nEnemies include animals like bats, snakes and spiders of varying sizes, other characters, and monsters like yeti, man-eating plants and ghosts. The player can collect many items, mainly gold and jewels which add to the player's score, but also useful objects including bombs, guns, climbing gear and archaeological artifacts. Some of the latter have supernatural abilities, including kapalas, hedjets, crystal skulls and golden ankhs, though many of these special items can only be gained through secret methods, like combining other items together. Some items may be purchased or stolen from shops scattered about the caves, though the shopkeeper becomes a powerful enemy if you steal from him. \n \n \nThe player can also encounter damsels in distress trapped in the caves, who can be picked up and carried to an exit. Successfully doing so returns health to the player. It's possible to unlock the damsel as a playable character; gameplay is identical, except that the player encounters spelunkers to rescue. Another unlockable character is the \"Tunnel Man\", who possesses a mattock instead of a whip. \n \n \nThe Xbox Live Arcade version of the game features local multiplayer (co-op and deathmatch) for up to four players. There are 9 different characters to play as. \n \n \nSpelunky also includes a level editor, in which players can create their own non-random levels to share with others.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jcp8odbymhh6exidv1ev.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "jcp8odbymhh6exidv1ev", "height": 544}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iyydvheenwo5ftsb6dse.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "iyydvheenwo5ftsb6dse", "height": 544}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mwt9kanz0ahs755liln6.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "mwt9kanz0ahs755liln6", "height": 544}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kmz2lzgrj4aijosc6ptf.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "kmz2lzgrj4aijosc6ptf", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mrkcq2ahpvbunklcyqv2.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "mrkcq2ahpvbunklcyqv2", "height": 360}], "id": 3029}, {"genres": [8], "name": "South Park: Tenorman's Revenge", "videos": [{"video_id": "FBMoImbxk68", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k615qdrjc8wgbrnt5zkp.jpg", "width": 1600, "cloudinary_id": "k615qdrjc8wgbrnt5zkp", "height": 930}, "summary": "South Park: Tenorman\\'s Revenge is a 2-D sidescroller that lets you play as Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny as they battle Tenorman\\'s \\\"ginger army\\\" across time and space.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ogjbzj93nvdxglkzmjyt.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "ogjbzj93nvdxglkzmjyt", "height": 562}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qp0uxcqlbqfgpvydtit0.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "qp0uxcqlbqfgpvydtit0", "height": 562}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jr5palrybpfpvfab0jfo.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "jr5palrybpfpvfab0jfo", "height": 562}], "id": 1261}, {"genres": [8, 25, 31], "name": "Sonic Unleashed", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dvv62jgk1d64xilnt3rw.jpg", "width": 240, "cloudinary_id": "dvv62jgk1d64xilnt3rw", "height": 300}, "summary": "Gameplay in Sonic Unleashed focuses on two modes of platforming play: fast-paced levels that take place during daytime, showcasing Sonic's trademark speed as seen in previous games in the series, and slower, night-time levels, during which Sonic's Werehog form emerges, and gameplay switches to an action-based, brawler style of play, in which Sonic battles Gaia enemies", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uueqhjieekguhjxw6mnb.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "uueqhjieekguhjxw6mnb", "height": 270}], "id": 5169}]
