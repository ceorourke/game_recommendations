An army of Robot Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard, invades this world and destroys the Heart of the World, the world core.

Globox gives Rayman a silver lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which restores his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship, and is separated from Globox again. He learns that to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find four ancient magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world, hidden in secret and mysterious sanctuaries consisting of the four elements water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air.[10] He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies.[10] \n \nIn the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir. \n \nEventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes.

He then escapes by stealing a police helicopter and flying to the Information Center, where he steals the Constructopedia, the book containing the blueprints for all buildings on the island. He then tears pages out of the book, causing all of the buildings on LEGO Island to deconstruct. Having summoned the Brickster-Bots, the Brickster departs for his asteroid island, Ogel Island.\n\nThe Infomaniac informs Pepper that he must destroy the Brickster-Bots and track down the missing pages of the Constructopedia. He soon begins to locate a few of the pages. With each page returned, a building is re-constructed.\n\nPepper then ventures to Castle Island, where the Brickster has deconstructed the bridge; while diving to connect its two halves, he finds the bricks and a page. He then finds that another page is up on the Bull's castle flag pole, as the Lions stole the Bulls's real flag. The Bulls promise to give Pepper the flag, as long as he returns the stolen flag. The Lions agree to give Pepper the flag, as long as he defeated the Bull's Dark Knight in a joust. After defeating the Dark Knight, Pepper receives the Bull's flag from the Lions, to give it to the Bulls. However, before the Bulls give the flag to Pepper, he has to engage in a cannon battle with Cedric the Bull, an ally of the Brickster, as he steals the page, just as the other Bulls are about to give the page to Pepper. After defeating Cedric the Bull, Pepper acquires the page, signalling his time to leave Castle Island.\n\nPepper then returns home, collects more pages, then flies through a portal to Adventurers Island with a helicopter. Upon landing, he meets Johnny Thunder and Pippin Reed, who agree to help him track down the pages on the island as long as he helps them. After defending the Adventurer's truck from snakes as they drive through the desert, they find Dr. Kilroy at some nearby tombs. Pepper retrieves gems from inside a sphinx, then ventures inside the mummy's tomb to get a Constructopedia page. Pepper then drives a car to the desert oasis, to get another page from a large fish that swallowed it, before meeting up again with the Adventurers. The entire team then flies to the jungle, where they learn that Mr. Hates has taken several dinosaurs captive. Pepper rides a t-rex to Mr. Hates's camp and rescues the dinosaurs with the aid of a hot air balloon, then defeats Mr. Hates and gets a page from him. Pepper then says goodbye to the Adventurers and returns to LEGO Island.\n\nUpon returning home, Papa and Mama Brickolini are kidnapped by the Brickster and a group of his Brickster-Bots. Pepper then collects the final pages of the Constructopedia on LEGO Island and earns a special radio from the Radio Station, which now is the only way to stun the Brickster-Bots, as they became immune to pizza.\n\nPepper then walks to the space port, and, after centrifuge and parachute training, takes a space shuttle to Ogel Island. Pepper's initial obstacle is an asteroid belt leading to Ogel Island, however, he manages to navigate it without much hassle. Since the Brickster stole the landing gear and deconstructs the landing platform on Ogel Island, Pepper has to parachute down. On the asteroid, he makes pizzas to send the citizens to sleep, while getting Mama and Papa out of their situation.

Pajitnov often programmed games to test new equipment using simple tasks, and in his spare time, developed a computer game inspired by his favorite puzzle board game Pentominos. The objective of Pentominos was to fit 12 different geometric-shaped pieces formed out of five squares into a box.\n\nPajitnov\u2019s vision was to create an electronic game where players arranged puzzle pieces in real time by having them \u201cfall\u201d faster and faster from the top of the screen. Pajitnov designed the game using seven distinctive playing pieces made from four squares. He called it Tetris, after \u201ctetra,\u201d the Greek word for four, and tennis, his favorite sport. After giving the game to his colleagues, it became an instant, hugely addictive hit, and shortly thereafter spread like wildfire throughout the Soviet Bloc\u2019s computer literate. His subsequent friendship with game designer, Henk Rogers, now Blue Planet Software Chairman and Managing Director of The Tetris Company, brought the Tetris game out of the Soviet Union to become one of the most widely played electronic games of all time.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcehoplgl03esbequtb2.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "hcehoplgl03esbequtb2", "height": 240}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cvhlnnx1clyczp444ipm.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "cvhlnnx1clyczp444ipm", "height": 240}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/egylbje6gmdjvuxrjtfr.jpg", "width": 511, "cloudinary_id": "egylbje6gmdjvuxrjtfr", "height": 464}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zu5jsg09hltplkuvrqrc.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "zu5jsg09hltplkuvrqrc", "height": 300}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lhnfpvszmgzpswavu0qm.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "lhnfpvszmgzpswavu0qm", "height": 240}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vg8hfhzqxhksotzgoqjv.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "vg8hfhzqxhksotzgoqjv", "height": 240}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ycgkctzmfbevocfflibf.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "ycgkctzmfbevocfflibf", "height": 300}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aejdaphpoi7s0wa1srhg.jpg", "width": 511, "cloudinary_id": "aejdaphpoi7s0wa1srhg", "height": 464}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q5tsvxn51l9vsasgztnw.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "q5tsvxn51l9vsasgztnw", "height": 300}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l5vjjtivyfrjrph0fvco.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "l5vjjtivyfrjrph0fvco", "height": 240}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/okl0v4tfan8njy1auqvr.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "okl0v4tfan8njy1auqvr", "height": 240}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nrminrrv8fmkwsnpeaiq.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "nrminrrv8fmkwsnpeaiq", "height": 300}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aqwt6anwzqzcj7pykyp8.jpg", "width": 511, "cloudinary_id": "aqwt6anwzqzcj7pykyp8", "height": 464}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zqqohs8fdgypjgakr81w.jpg", "width": 511, "cloudinary_id": "zqqohs8fdgypjgakr81w", "height": 464}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pa9uen7xef9o4jy2zxyk.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "pa9uen7xef9o4jy2zxyk", "height": 240}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o2thjpnlbfdqockltm4s.jpg", "width": 360, "cloudinary_id": "o2thjpnlbfdqockltm4s", "height": 240}], "id": 8197}, {"genres": [10, 14], "summary": "No Fear Downhill Mountain Biking is a mountain bike video game released in 1999 on PlayStation and 2001 on the Game Boy Color, Dreamcast version been planned but never released.

While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn.

The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story.

Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. \nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. \nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games.

The object of the game is to ski down an endless slope and avoid the obstacles.\n\nPirih had created SkiFree in C on his home computer for his own education and entertainment. The game eventually attracted the attention of a program manager for Microsoft Entertainment Pack when he noticed Pirih playing it at work, leading to the inclusion of the game in the next Entertainment Pack release with Pirih's consent.\n\nThe game was featured in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack and was available as a ported version for the original Macintosh. SkiFree was also one of seven games included in The Best of Entertainment Pack released for Game Boy Color in 2001.\n\nIn 1993, Pirih started work on a second version of the game, but it was abandoned for other projects as the original source code was lost. It was finally released in 2008.\n\nBecause the initial SkiFree release was a 16-bit Windows program, compatibility issues arose when running the game in newer versions of Windows. Pirih noted that users of Windows XP can configure the operating system to run 16-bit Windows programs, resolving the problem for some. Other solutions involve running Windows 3.1 in DOSBox.\n\nOn April 4, 2005, Pirih announced the rediscovery of the game's source code and the creation of a 32-bit version of SkiFree. The updated version is available on his official SkiFree website.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the user has four choices:\n\nEnter the Free-style course (with the objective of collecting \"style points\" by doing flips, going over moguls, etc.).\nEnter the Slalom course (with the objective of completing an opened slalom course in the shortest time possible).\nEnter the Tree Slalom course (similar to the Slalom course, but longer, with narrower-spaced flags, and with trees interspersed).\nEnter none of the courses, and just \"ski free\".\nOn all courses, obstacles such as trees and rocks appear, as do non-player characters such as other skiers and fast-moving snowboarders.

The player controls a small squad of up to five soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset, the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles such as Jeeps, tanks and helicopters as well as missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates - destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion - at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at a greater risk of depleting ammunition.\n\nThe player proceeds through 23 missions divided into several levels each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including jungle, snow and desert, some with unique terrain features and vehicles such as igloos and snowmobiles. The player must also contend with rivers (crossing which soldiers are slowed and cannot fire) and quicksand as well as mines and other booby traps. In addition to shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and-click control system more common to strategy than action games.[9] As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, he must use caution, as well as careful planning and positioning. To this end, he can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g6kbluv2fv1jbtqh6taz.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "g6kbluv2fv1jbtqh6taz", "height": 400}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fs8zks8ncaxdfik4gtcf.jpg", "width": 641, "cloudinary_id": "fs8zks8ncaxdfik4gtcf", "height": 401}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tbkmdn91qp06zrqgnqms.jpg", "width": 610, "cloudinary_id": "tbkmdn91qp06zrqgnqms", "height": 402}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ueeypjhgxnzb4eygnrmg.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "ueeypjhgxnzb4eygnrmg", "height": 433}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hedqiofuz3bz1aaftb0r.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "hedqiofuz3bz1aaftb0r", "height": 480}], "id": 5519}, {"genres": [31, 33], "name": "Dragon's Lair", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/trtdoirr7vwficqvvb1x.jpg", "width": 200, "cloudinary_id": "trtdoirr7vwficqvvb1x", "height": 307}, "summary": "Haven't heard of Dragon's Lair?!

The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.\n\nThe game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.\n\nControlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.\n\nDelivering the papers\nThe paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.\n\n\nIn Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street.\nThe primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.\n\nKeeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.\n\nThe player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.\n\nThere are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.\n\nAlong the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.\n\nA 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.\n\n\nTraining course\nPaperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker.\nThe end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.\n\n\nFinish line bug\nA bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.\n\nRecapping the delivery\nThe next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.\n\nThe game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.\n\nLosing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"\n\nThe arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.\n\n\nPORTS:\nPaperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.\n\nUnlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.\n\nMore recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003.\nA Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.\n\nPaperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.\n\nAn iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s29dx0vdizqqbw5vpxbl.jpg", "width": 512, "cloudinary_id": "s29dx0vdizqqbw5vpxbl", "height": 384}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hz9edpqsrkywr9ci1b4y.jpg", "width": 512, "cloudinary_id": "hz9edpqsrkywr9ci1b4y", "height": 384}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/idugnjxjvjttyane7bhl.jpg", "width": 1440, "cloudinary_id": "idugnjxjvjttyane7bhl", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pvgwxx6im9gxwopvrtr7.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "pvgwxx6im9gxwopvrtr7", "height": 448}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nsoegta4imoyaeztqif4.jpg", "width": 259, "cloudinary_id": "nsoegta4imoyaeztqif4", "height": 194}], "id": 11762}, {"genres": [12, 31], "summary": "You wash up on the shore of a deserted island after the cruise ship that you were on with your parents sank in a storm.

The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game's 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O'Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game's release. \n \nThe management side of O'Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team. \n \nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Den\u00edlson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning. \n \nThe club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team. \n \nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week.
