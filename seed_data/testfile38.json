[{"genres": [8], "summary": "Crash of the Titans is a platform game published by Sierra Entertainment and developed by Vancouver-based Radical Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable (ported by SuperVillain Studios), Wii and Xbox 360. The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game were developed by Amaze Entertainment. The game was first released in North America on October 3, 2007, in Europe on October 12, 2007 and in Australia on October 25, 2007. It is the first game in the Crash Bandicoot series not to have a Japanese release. \n \nCrash of the Titans is the fourteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series and the sixth game in the main franchise, but it is the first in the Mutant series. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as \"Mojo\", which the antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, plans to use to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of loyal mutants known as \"Titans\". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex by using the technique of \"jacking\" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo. \n \nThe game received mixed reviews upon its release; critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game. Despite this mediocre reception, the game was nominated for two awards.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rbt5nnvinb3mimxpaixl.jpg", "width": 760, "cloudinary_id": "rbt5nnvinb3mimxpaixl", "height": 983}, "id": 1190, "name": "Crash of the Titans"}, {"genres": [8], "name": "Crash: Mind over Mutant", "videos": [{"video_id": "1yf3ZySIBxc", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vrsffvnyyhunmr1dlolq.jpg", "width": 563, "cloudinary_id": "vrsffvnyyhunmr1dlolq", "height": 720}, "summary": "In Crash Bandicoot: Mind Over Mutant, a rejuvenated Neo Cortex is taking over the world one brain at a time!

The Prince now has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from The Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular \"wave\" of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies as well as damaging them. The dark tone, a vastly increased level of blood and violence as well as sexualized female NPCs earned the game an M ESRB rating.", "storyline": "Set seven years after the events of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the Prince finds himself constantly hunted by a terrible beast known as the Dahaka. The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases The Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka's mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.    \nHe later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time's fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past. The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black, whose name is Shahdee. Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time, who is busy preparing to create the Sands, Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides. The Prince makes his way through the fortress, utilizing the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present, and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka, who he discovers cannot pass through water. The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress - the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower - that serve as locks to the door. He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself, who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate, just as the Prince is doing. A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious; he kills Kaileena and returns to the present. What lies ahead is the most dramatic Twist in the Prince's life, and He starts believing the priest who told him \"You cant change your Fate! No Man Can..\"  But Prince is not going to give up that easily.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fgu93hfwgaxplv0wxjof.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "fgu93hfwgaxplv0wxjof", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl0y51arwkuojwnacjuh.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "pl0y51arwkuojwnacjuh", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mjvy64ze3eamjlenvyrd.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "mjvy64ze3eamjlenvyrd", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/okrsxfeimtpcqjq2kcad.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "okrsxfeimtpcqjq2kcad", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wdte0mkqkcd1d3pmyv9x.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "wdte0mkqkcd1d3pmyv9x", "height": 600}], "id": 837}, {"genres": [12, 31], "name": "Sid Meier's Pirates!", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nxqe44trdvqwcytk49yk.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "nxqe44trdvqwcytk49yk", "height": 921}, "summary": "Based on Sid Meier's original masterpiece, Pirates!, Sid Meier's Pirates! has you facing countless dogged enemies, wooing fair maidens and raising the Jolly Roger on the high seas in pursuit of riches.

The Ghosts are more powerful with an upgraded Integrated Warfighter System (IWS), but will have only 72 hours to assess the threat and stop the rebels from reaching U.S. soil. With a border that's 1,900 miles long and an enemy that doesn't play by the rules, this is a job for the U.S. military's most elite fighting unit. This is a job for the Ghosts.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n90wpbrd0r3mwuejx2rq.jpg", "width": 900, "cloudinary_id": "n90wpbrd0r3mwuejx2rq", "height": 506}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zmmmwfjdkhdu4lmzt4kl.jpg", "width": 900, "cloudinary_id": "zmmmwfjdkhdu4lmzt4kl", "height": 506}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u2m47ldkqchhlnpeydti.jpg", "width": 900, "cloudinary_id": "u2m47ldkqchhlnpeydti", "height": 506}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k1but4rczukeitclpzx4.jpg", "width": 900, "cloudinary_id": "k1but4rczukeitclpzx4", "height": 506}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pbikiedi7faoayg770zr.jpg", "width": 900, "cloudinary_id": "pbikiedi7faoayg770zr", "height": 506}], "id": 1301}, {"genres": [5, 15], "name": "Medal of Honor: Heroes", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iojbxefycch1ylypjssx.jpg", "width": 280, "cloudinary_id": "iojbxefycch1ylypjssx", "height": 480}, "summary": "Medal of Honor: Heroes is a World War II first-person shooter video game developed by Team Fusion for the PlayStation Portable, and is the ninth installment in the Medal of Honor series.

In August of 1999, Agent Ellis attempted to infiltrate Rhoemer's narcotics operation in Gu\u00e1cimo, Costa Rica, but was discovered and executed by ex-KGB agent Mara Aramov. Rhoemer then ordered Anton Girdeux, a French mercenary, to burn down the plantation to hide the evidence of their Syphon Filter research.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Edward Benton, the Agency Deputy Director, is briefing Logan's mission to Agency Director Thomas Markinson and a shadowy, unnamed figure. Several weeks later, Gabe and Lian investigate a mysterious viral outbreak in the Himalayas, which leaves only a single survivor. (Lian describes this as impossible.)\n\nThe game begins one month after the events in Costa Rica. Rhoemer and his terrorists have launched an assault on Washington, D.C. Gabe defeats Pavel Kravitch, Rhoemer's communications expert, which allows him to gain entry to the Washington Metro. Once inside, an explosive goes off leaving Gabe trapped underground. He pursues Aramov, catching her in the tunnels before heading to a nearby park to aid in the defusing of several viral bombs, where he learns that Aramov has escaped custody. Making his way to the Freedom Memorial, Gabe takes on and defeats Jorge Marcos, Rhoemer's trigger man, before he incinerates Girdeaux.\n\nLab results show that Syphon Filter is a deadly next-generation biological weapon, capable of targeting specific demographics. Jonathan Phagan, PHARCOM's CEO and founder, attends a gala at his new Expo Center Museum in New York City, where he is taken captive by Aramov and Benton is revealed as a double agent. Gabe kills Benton and frees Phagan, but Aramov, who is captured, again escapes custody.\n\nGabe goes to Rhoemer's secret base in Rozova, Kazakhstan. He kills Rhoemer's commander Vladislav Gabrek and destroys the base, but Lian is taken captive and presumably killed by Rhoemer.\n\nGabe is then sent to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, which is an abandoned cathedral. Injecting viral patients with what he is convinced is an antidote, Gabe descends deeper into the cathedral to rescue Lian; who explains that there is no 'global' antidote for the virus. They also find Phagan, who is later killed by Aramov. She decides to help Gabe and Lian, since she has nowhere else to go.\n\nGabe then infiltrates the PHARCOM warehouses in Almaty, Kazakhstan, where PHARCOM security is battling Rhoemer's men. Gabe learns that Markinson, who had been secretly negotiating with Rhoemer to obtain Syphon Filter for the Agency, had made Gabe inject the patients with potassium chloride. Rhoemer reveals he has captured a Soviet-era nuclear ICBM. Rhoemer shoots Markinson and starts the launch sequence for the missile. Gabe cannot prevent it from launching, so his only hope is to initiate its self-destruct sequence once it is in the upper atmosphere. Gabe successfully destroys the missile. Rhoemer, furious at Logan's interference, engages him in a final showdown. Gabe is able to kill him and avert World War III.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the shadowy figure from the beginning of the game is holding a sample of Syphon Filter inside the Agency's headquarters with Aramov, who is laughing.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rfnuz5zbjzccpurzmrwm.jpg", "width": 801, "cloudinary_id": "rfnuz5zbjzccpurzmrwm", "height": 601}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ridu3mopopndoh6tlmta.jpg", "width": 634, "cloudinary_id": "ridu3mopopndoh6tlmta", "height": 478}], "id": 4115}, {"genres": [10], "summary": "Experience wicked air and in-you-face action in the most complete motocross game ever offered!

In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion. \n \nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage. \n \nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them.

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. \nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. \nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frj7es6ak4g6if4bs3df.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "frj7es6ak4g6if4bs3df", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gho1yattixqth0skvueo.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "gho1yattixqth0skvueo", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d5ovnsnje55odia1mjtq.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "d5ovnsnje55odia1mjtq", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j7bg8nax9azvoizhildo.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "j7bg8nax9azvoizhildo", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qmtdiyyqcolrhpjumx9t.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "qmtdiyyqcolrhpjumx9t", "height": 272}], "id": 4689}, {"genres": [7], "name": "PaRappa the Rapper", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fbxrfqr6jexenlc2palp.jpg", "width": 600, "cloudinary_id": "fbxrfqr6jexenlc2palp", "height": 600}, "summary": "The original music video game. \n \nHelp Parappa rap with the best of the master rappers and straight into Sunny's heart. \n \nGuaranteed you'll be singin' and dancin' along with Parappa and his pals to the most fun music mixes.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rqvkyzh01c20cu4ta5fe.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "rqvkyzh01c20cu4ta5fe", "height": 225}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hweapjlqax6wdj0075cf.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "hweapjlqax6wdj0075cf", "height": 453}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ibvicjsfxadq70nmuxco.jpg", "width": 940, "cloudinary_id": "ibvicjsfxadq70nmuxco", "height": 528}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/argw7gckbzsh7mkaghel.jpg", "width": 603, "cloudinary_id": "argw7gckbzsh7mkaghel", "height": 402}], "id": 6080}, {"genres": [9], "name": "Lumines II", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ljnwg5svh7xzri2zr1vf.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "ljnwg5svh7xzri2zr1vf", "height": 442}, "summary": "The gameplay in Lumines II is very similar to its predecessor, Lumines.

A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile. \n \nAcid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character's movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \"Active Command Intelligence Duel\". The cards are not truly collectible, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs. \n \nBefore each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. The majority of the cards are based upon elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player's hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as they are intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher. \n \nCost is an important factor in game play and can be summed up as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 15 and a guard has a cost of 10, then the guard's turn would occur before the character's. \n \nSome cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don't need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards. \n \nMultiplayer, or \"Link Battle\", is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running Acid can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a \"sneak-off\". The objective is to collect a certain number of diskettes before the rival player.

This is the first title in the series to alter the traditional tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action\" to \"Tactical Espionage Operations\", referring to the base building and mission mechanics of the game. \n \nSet in 1974 in Costa Rica, the game follows the exploits of returning protagonist Big Boss (previously known as Naked Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, now known simply as Snake) as he runs the mercenary unit Militaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Soldiers Without Borders). \n \nPeace Walker consists of two primary playing modes: \"Mission\" and \"Mother Base\". \"Mission\" are the actual action sequences of the game, where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory, whereas \"Mother Base\" is a crew managing simulation mode similar to the \"Comrade System\" in Portable Ops. \n \nMissions \nPlayers get to choose which missions to play from the \"Mission Selector\" screen. There are two main types of Missions: Main Ops are the primary story-based missions in which goals are determined by the narrative and must be played in a strict order in order to proceed. Some Main Ops missions include illustrated cutscenes that involve bits of interactivity in order to proceed. Extra Ops are optional side-missions that involve much more elaborate goals ranging from simple target practices to obtaining secret documents. \n \nWhen the player completes a mission, his or her performance is evaluated afterward. A player's score is penalized with a lower rank and reduced heroism for excessive killing and frequently being discovered, whereas players who are stealthy and subdue enemy soldiers non-lethally will be awarded appropriately. Players can replay previously cleared missions for higher ranks. \n \nPlayers can go through missions as Snake or as an MSF soldier (male or female). Some missions will only be available to Snake, and likewise for MSF soldiers. \n \nThe game adopts certain mechanics from Metal Gear Solid 4, such as the ability to move while crouched, the over-the-shoulder shooting view, the CQC system, and the ability to search held-up soldiers. The truck from Portable Ops, where players can bring subdued enemies for recruitment, has been discarded in favor of the Fulton Recovery System, which players attach to subdued soldiers and prisoners. The Wi-Fi recruitment system from Portable Ops has been modified so that instead of tapping the Circle button to obtain a strong enough signal from an access point, the player will have to knockout soldiers using CQC to accept them. The cardboard box used to hide from enemy soldiers is now available in two-man versions called Love Boxes, which have different variants. The Surround Indicator in Portable Ops can also be used only when it is equipped in the item box and players will also develop and use an early version of the Soliton radar system from Metal Gear Solid. The game features the camouflage index system from Snake Eater, but the player does not have the ability to change camouflage uniforms during a mission as the point index will be entirely based on movement, position, and the size of the weapon equipped in the weapon box. The player can also use marking devices to call in artillery strikes or resupply drops. \n \nMovement is done on the analog stick; actions such as co-op actions use the directional-pad; melee actions, which include multiple throws into crowds of enemies, use the R button; and weapons use the L button with the R button. Players will be unable to move or shoot while lying down and while pinned on a wall. The player can set the control system according to that of Portable Ops, Guns of the Patriots, or Capcom's Monster Hunter. \n \nBefore starting a mission, the player can determine his or her character's item and weapon load-out, including the character's uniform. The player's carrying capacity is limited and any excessive items that the player obtains during a mission will be transferred over to Mother Base's inventory. There are four primary types of uniforms that can be worn by the player. \n \nJungle Fatigues \u2014 The default uniform for Snake and MSF Soldiers. A balance of stealth, defense, weapons, and inventory. Available in multiple camouflage patterns. \nNaked \u2014 A shirtless version of the Jungle Fatigues, players using Naked uniforms move fast at the cost of lower stealth, weaker defense, and fewer items. \nSneaking Suit \u2014 Resembles the sneaking suit worn by Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, it allows players to move without generating foot noises and have higher camouflage compared to other suits while moving, but restricts them to five items and six secondary weapons. \nBattle Dress \u2014 A heavily armored suit that allows the player to carry a third primary weapon and absorb heavy firepower, but at the cost of a lower item carrying capacity, slower mobility and a lower camouflage index. A variant outfitted with a helmet is also available, which increases the defenses. \n \nMother Base \nThe Mother Base is an abandoned OTEC research platform in the Caribbean that serves as the MSF's headquarters. Aside from managing the combat, medical, intelligence, and technology research teams seen in MPO, the player can assign personnel to the mess hall crew to feed the troops and keep up their morale. Rebellious or injured personnel can be brought to the brig and sickbay, respectively. The player will also have a chance to capture military vehicles that appear in the game as minor boss opponents, such as armored personnel carriers, tanks, and attack helicopters. Up to 350 soldiers can be recruited; excess staff caught in a mission must be discharged and up to 50 vehicles can be captured over the course of the game. \n \nItems and weapons are not procured on-site, but rather they're developed by MSF's R&D division based on blueprints obtained from missions. New items and weapons can only be developed when the player has sufficient GMP and certain MSF divisions have both reached the required level. Once development of an item has been completed, the R&D staff will automatically mass-produce them for the entire army. \n \nOuter Ops is a new game mechanic where players can deploy their combat unit soldiers (with the exception of Snake and other unique characters) and captured vehicles on certain missions against computer opponents. Each assault force codenamed from Alpha to Hotel has eight slots for assigning vehicles or soldiers, who can gain combat bonuses such as additional hit points and Psyche points, and generate income for the team. Depending on the scale of the enemy's firepower, MSF soldiers who are defeated during the battle can either die or be brought to sickbay for treatment. Vehicles that show damage in one mission will still show damage unless they are taken off the front for repairs, while decommissioned vehicles will be stricken from the inventory. \n \nMultiplayer \nThe Comrade System from Portable Ops has been removed in favor of a cooperative play mode called \"Co-Ops\", which allows two players to play most sneaking missions and four players in boss missions. There are several actions that can take place when two players are next to each other. 'Snake-in' allows players to hold on to each other as one player leads the way, also allowing the players to fire on the move. Other co-operative actions include holding up closing doors, performing CPR on fallen comrades, sharing items, and acting as a spotter for other players whose vision is obscured. \n \nVersus Ops are multiplayer matches played over special versions of certain maps. The player has a choice of whether to organize individual or team deathmatches, base capture and quetzal capture missions. Only certain items or weapons unlocked in the single-player campaign can be used in the mode. Each match can gather up to six players with restrictions included, such as life and psyche points not regained and limited time for CPR revivals.", "storyline": "Four years after the events of the San Hieronymo incident, Big Boss\u2014who prefers his original title, Snake\u2014and Kaz Miller have established Militaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res, a small mercenary faction, on the Colombian coast. They are approached by Ramon Galvez Mena, a professor at the University of Peace, and his student, Paz Ortega Andrade. Galvez attempts to hire MSF to investigate an army that has discreetly occupied parts of Costa Rica. Snake refuses, identifying Galvez as a KGB agent, but is convinced when Paz plays a recording of The Boss. \n \nWhen Snake arrives in Costa Rica, he begins to suspect that the mystery army has brought nuclear weapons with them. Enlisting the help of the Sandinista Liberation Army, he tracks a shipment to a research facility deep in the mountains. His suspicions are confirmed when he witnesses Hot Coldman, a senior CIA agent, announce his intentions to fire a live nuclear weapon as part of a project code-named \"Peace Walker,\" a fail-deadly nuclear tank. Snake reveals himself to Huey Emmerich, one of Peace Walker's designers, who agrees to help him stop Coldman. \n \nFollowing Huey's instructions, Snake ventures deeper into Costa Rica, searching for Dr. Strangelove, the designer of Peace Walker's artificial intelligence systems. He discovers that Strangelove has based Peace Walker's primary control systems on The Boss' personality. She demands to know whether The Boss genuinely defected to the Soviet Union, or if she died on a mission that was covered up, going so far as to torture Snake for information. \n \nSnake escapes custody and attempts in vain to destroy Peace Walker, a quadrupedal nuclear launch platform. He chases Peace Walker across the Nicaraguan border to an American airbase on the shores of Lake Cocibolca. Discovering that the base has been occupied by Soviet soldiers, Snake infiltrates the facility to confront Coldman. Coldman reveals the purpose of Peace Walker: he believes that nuclear deterrence is a flawed theory, relying on humans to retaliate in the event of a nuclear exchange, whom he believes to be unwilling to destroy their own race. As an impartial artificial intelligence, Peace Walker would guarantee retaliation, and Coldman intends to fire a warhead to prove it. Suddenly, the facility is overrun by Soviet soldiers, led by Galvez, who reveals himself as Vladimir Zadornov. Zadornov intends to hijack Peace Walker for the Soviet Union, but the standoff is broken by the arrival of MSF and the Sandinistas, giving Snake enough time to destroy Peace Walker. \n \nIn the aftermath of the battle, Zadornov is captured and Coldman mortally wounded. In his dying moments, Coldman activates Peace Walker's data uplink, convincing NORAD that the United States is about to be hit by a Soviet nuclear strike. Snake contacts NORAD, and tries to convince them to stand down, but senior members of the armed forces refuse and plan to retaliate. With a nuclear strike imminent, The Boss' personality takes control of Peace Walker's damaged artificial intelligence and drowns Peace Walker in Lake Cocibolca, severing the connection and ending the threat. \n \nSome time later, Zadornov repeatedly escapes from MSF, arousing Snake's suspicions that someone has betrayed them. Paz reveals herself to be the traitor, using Zadornov's escapes to seize control of Metal Gear ZEKE, a walking tank designed by Huey to act as MSF's deterrent against foreign intervention. Acting as an agent of Major Zero\u2014now using the name \"Cipher\"\u2014Paz issues Snake an ultimatum: surrender MSF to Cipher and become his deterrent, or else she will fire a nuclear warhead on America, at which point they will be branded a nuclear-equipped extremist cult, and the world will unite in their pursuit of MSF. Snake prevents the launch by crippling ZEKE, and Paz is thrown into the ocean. In the aftermath, Snake reconciles with his memory of The Boss and accepts the title of Big Boss as he rallies the soldiers of MSF to prepare for a fight for their survival, declaring them to be living in \"Outer Heaven\".", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jfmjqyjtnoou6tprcroh.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "jfmjqyjtnoou6tprcroh", "height": 1088}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pirfhsul3pk6amfensrd.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "pirfhsul3pk6amfensrd", "height": 1088}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sus9gspg4uui9kykzzu9.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "sus9gspg4uui9kykzzu9", "height": 1088}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsiul7inry1glocshps6.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "dsiul7inry1glocshps6", "height": 725}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/szyemzq4rpsz36dklkny.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "szyemzq4rpsz36dklkny", "height": 720}], "id": 382}, {"genres": [25], "name": "Samurai Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends", "videos": [{"video_id": "gKJ06bkplyY", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uvaflusbl92ekyh2tvj8.jpg", "width": 862, "cloudinary_id": "uvaflusbl92ekyh2tvj8", "height": 1000}, "summary": "Samurai Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends is the first expansion of the 2009 title Samurai Warriors 3.

When Hayato is about to test his \"Dragon Unit\" flight pack on the school's roof, a girl falls from the sky, wearing a similar device. He tries to save her, but falls to his death; after this, he is transported back in time without any memory of the event, and manages to save her. Her name turns out to be Arika Tokitou. Ryuusei Academy and the Second Science Club prepare for a school festival that is scheduled for a month later, when Hayato's science professor, Genkuro Kanbara, gives him a smartphone chip composed of an \"Agastia Stone\", which theoretically would allow him to receive voice messages from the future. He installs it and does receive messages from the future, but is unable to tell what they are saying.\n\nAt one point, due to an accident with the Dragon Unit, Hayato's house blows up, forcing him to sleep in the science clubroom. He and the rest of the club decide that for the festival, they should put on a live performance for Hikari. During the month, Hayato and Hikari get closer, and he moves in with her. He helps her overcome issues with self confidence and to succeed at the live performance, and they become a couple. At the end of the festival, time moves backwards to September 11 again; the same month loops several times, with Hayato being unaware of it and having no memory of past loops. During each loop, he gets closely involved with one of the game's female characters, helps them with the festival, and with resolving their personal problems. While Arika is distant at first, she starts to lighten up to Hayato the more loops he goes through.\n\nAfter going through several loops, Hayato returns to September 11 with his memories intact, and realizes that Arika is the only one who appears to have a connection to the looping. He confronts her, and while she admits to have a connection, she does not trust him to help her. When Hayato realizes that his house is about to explode, with Hikari and Arika inside, he gets them out instead of saving the Dragon Unit; this earns him Arika's trust, and she tells him that she is a time traveler from 2040. Learning that her presence caused a time loop, she wanted to return to her time, but was unable to as her time machine had broken. Hayato gathers parts to repair it with, and again gets close to Hikari. He learns that Arika's true identity is Akari Hino, and that she is Hayato and Hikari's daughter from the future. In the future, Hayato had become a workaholic, building a time machine while neglecting Hikari and Akira; in anger, Akira had stolen the time machine and traveled to 2018. As the time machine only works in a zero-gravity environment, they combine it with the Dragon Unit and take it to the 1,200 feet Sky Tower; their way there is hindered by an earthquake, but they are able to reach it with the help of Hikari, Tamaki, Yuzu, Nanari, and professor Kanbara.\n\nThe sender of the voice messages from the future is revealed to be the Hayato of 2040; as the future versions of Hayato and Hikari had seen Akari in 2018, they knew that they needed to recreate the events in order to avoid a time paradox that would cause Akari to cease existing. Because of this, Hayato had spent all of his time on creating a time machine by 2040, while he acted cold to Akari on purpose to give her incentive to travel back in time. The Hayato of 2040 then sent voice messages to his 2018 self to offer guidance and to cause an ontological paradox, ensuring Akari's continued existence. Akari travels back to 2040, breaking the loop, and makes up with her parents.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/srbljjjzufnugtxhshby.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "srbljjjzufnugtxhshby", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/olgpsryinen2tt59trww.jpg", "width": 1500, "cloudinary_id": "olgpsryinen2tt59trww", "height": 844}], "id": 18072}, {"genres": [5], "name": "Gradius Collection", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ntuvr9m2pghpaqdgnma0.jpg", "width": 160, "cloudinary_id": "ntuvr9m2pghpaqdgnma0", "height": 276}, "summary": "Gradius Collection is a compilation of five beloved games in the Gradius series available for the first time on the PSP system.

The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University. \n \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level. \n \nThe main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of \"moves\" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results. \n \nObstacles in levels include: \n \nBoxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled. \nGlass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through. \nLaser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level. \nSwitch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them. \nTeleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points. \nPolice officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior. \nDetectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles. \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a \"weekly quiz\" that can be downloaded through the Internet.", "id": 44506, "name": "PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2"}, {"genres": [15], "summary": "In PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe, the player controls a defender-of-the-forest character in a lush 2D environment.

Only the Quarp Jet is capable of a rescue operation because it has the power to teleport. Unfortunately the mission is further complicated by the invasion of a neighboring race. Moreover the ships can only be rescued after disabling their shields. The shields can only be disabled through circuit breakers. The circuit breakers are scattered, and must be deactivated in the correct order. In Velocity the player takes on the role of the Quarp Jet. They must find the station, disable their shields, and rescue the stranded ships. Concurrently they must also battle with the invading race, the Zetachron. \n \nVelocity is a shoot 'em up video game developed by FuturLab for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita as a PlayStation mini. \n \nVelocity\u200a'\u200bs gameplay involves navigating the Quarp Jet \u2013 a teleporting spacecraft \u2013 through space, whilst avoiding and defeating enemies using bombs that can be flung in cardinal directions. The main goal of the game is to rescue stranded ships. The game adds depth by introducing new abilities and obstacles. The stranded ships are protected by shields that must be disabled by switches in a specific order. The player's ship has the ability to fire bombs. The game allows the player to teleport their ship anywhere. It also allows the player create telepods which they can return to anytime. The telepods add a puzzle element to the game because the player has to return to activate the switches in the right order. \n \nThe following review was found at: http://www.deltaattack.com/2012/05/23/review-velocity-psp/ \n \nVelocity is hands-down the best PlayStation mini I\u2019ve experienced. Any fan of space-shooters or even of action games in general should strongly consider it. \n \nVelocity took a genre that I had thought done-to-death and revitalized it with highly innovative mechanics. You unlock them as you play through the first half of the game\u2019s 50 levels, and they are: \n \n- Hold R to scroll the screen more quickly. All levels scroll vertically upward, but this lets you increase the scroll speed. Some levels have a short time-limit, requiring you to boost most of the way through. \n \n- Hold Square to move a reticle for teleporting. Used to bypass obstacles, jump over a swarm of enemies, etc. \n \n- Press Circle to launch a bomb in the direction you last moved. Used for destructible obstacles and to decimate static enemies or tight groups of moving enemies. \n \n- Press Triangle to drop a telepod. At any point, you can press L to bring up a map of the level, then move the cursor between telepods, letting you jump back to an earlier part of the level. Necessary when splits occur in a level. Telepods are limited to a certain number per level. \n \nFurther complicating matters are color-coded security systems. Each one generates an instant-death laser field, and can only be disabled by attacking numbered switches in order. Telepods often come in to play with these, requiring you to backtrack in a level in order to trigger switches that you passed up earlier. \n \nThe point of all this is that a star has gone black-hole and is eating up your employer\u2019s mining operations. You must navigate the Quarp Jet through collapsed levels, rescuing miners and scientists stranded in escape capsules. You need to grab a minimum number of capsules in each level. \n \nOne nice feature Velocity has that most space-shooters don\u2019t is that you can run into walls without taking damage. That was an excellent design choice, because with all the speed-scrolling, teleporting, and narrow corridors, the game would be nearly impossible otherwise. Also, your ship has a life meter, so you can take several hits before dying, and you can even refill your health via in-level items. \n \nThe game also has a bumpin\u2019 soundtrack. It\u2019s impressive for a space-shooter in general, let alone a mini. Oddly, it will sometimes cut out between levels, but it\u2019s always there when you\u2019re actually playing. \n \nMy only real complaint about the game, and this is kind of a big one, is that difficulty is forced towards the end. You get experience (XP) based on how well you do in a level, and each level has a minimum XP requirement in order to play it, meaning you will eventually have to go back and play prior levels to get more XP before being able to beat the game. I was disheartened to see this, because otherwise you could make your own difficulty on the fly by being content with Bronze or Silver on a level, but as it is, you\u2019ll have to revisit levels to get Gold and additional XP. \n \nEven with forced-difficulty, this is a stellar title. Between the 50 levels, unlockable missions, a Minesweeper-type game, and the cheat codes and numerous other extra goodies, you\u2019ll get a lot of top-notch entertainment for your money.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pvvflapx7qjwbc85yht8.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "pvvflapx7qjwbc85yht8", "height": 272}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n92ciclpsotkhdsxn69k.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "n92ciclpsotkhdsxn69k", "height": 272}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fuqit3kpucvp5ij4a1gw.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "fuqit3kpucvp5ij4a1gw", "height": 272}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/llse91p1fkvhohcouxtm.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "llse91p1fkvhohcouxtm", "height": 272}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mtc3ydsgtox4j81yl6yw.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "mtc3ydsgtox4j81yl6yw", "height": 272}], "id": 9184}, {"genres": [7], "summary": "A rhythm game that allows the selection of all the K-On! members and their popular song releases.", "id": 38485, "name": "K-On!

We intended to deliver these words somewhat earlier, back when we covered Football Manager Handheld. Both games are, after all, football management sims based on popular PC forebears and revised for PSP, both were released around the same time, and indeed we started our reviewing in tandem. \n \nIt's just that Championship Manager 2006 has taken a little bit longer. \n \nThere are three reasons for this. The first is that, well, it's rather extensive. Whereas Football Manager Handheld opted for a cut-down, retro approach, Championship Manager 2006 goes the other way. It's every bit as huge as its PC parent, covering 55 leagues from the 12 leading footballing nations. \n \nGranted you can only play with the leagues of one country at a time, but each country has all the appropriate teams in all divisions, as well as reserve teams and youth squads. Each of the resultant 25,000 players has the usual mountain of statistics spread over five screens, detailing their skills, form and happiness, and they can all be trained, transfer-listed, praised or damned in the media, fined, demoted or promoted through the ranks, loaned or sold. \n \nThe transfer market is equally thorough, with a filtering system that enables you to search for specifically skilled players augmented by features like being able to scout or declare an interest in a player to unsettle them, and complex deals involving player-exchanges and sweeteners. With clubs negotiating deals or pulling out and media speculation and disgruntled footballers playing their part, Championship Manager 2006 feels real in a way that Football Manager Handheld didn't quite manage. \n \nThe matches themselves are equally involved affairs. There are six different ways to view the action, ranging from quick result to textual descriptions, possession bars, and a 2D match view complete with crowd sounds. \n \nThe latter is obviously the most tantalising attraction. When you're starting as a manager watching your charges (well, coloured circles) scurry around the pitch is even more hypnotic than viewing a mute pub TV, especially at the slowest speed. Combine this with more tactical options than Mourinho could ask for (custom formations, specific team and individual tactics, and even specific runs and passes for players to make) and you'll see how even pre-season friendlies can absorb hours. \n \nYou might also comprehend why it has taken us weeks of on-and-off play (and multiple recharges) to get through just a season. And though the more casual armchair manager might want to skip through things a little more rapidly (or even take advantage of the shorter Challenge mode), the faithful should be over the moon, Brian. \n \nSadly, the second reason for our delayed review \u2013 the interface \u2013 isn't as positive. At least ten per cent of our play time must have been frittered away getting to grips with it, and our first few attempts to navigate the hyperlink-strewn pages without a mouse were as frustrating as watching Lampard and Gerrard trying to play the same role in the England midfield. Whilst we did learn how to use shortcuts to ease this torment, the system (like Sven's formation) doesn't feel completely right. \n \nThe final reason for our tardiness? That's the trickiest. We've been reluctant to file our final review because we wanted to be sure how we felt. \n \nIn many ways, Championship Manager 2006 seems to have all the elements of a classic, but it just doesn't entirely convince us. \n \nPrincipally this is down to the match engine, which can feel like it's trying to recreate pinball rather than football. Stray passes, interceptions and the inability to beat players or shoot on target are all part of the real game, but the frequency of these events here in comparison to moments of flowing football are rather soul destroying. \n \nWorse, there's a distinct feeling that the result you get from watching a match is different to that from a quick result, with reported matches offering far more goals than games you play through. Extreme tactical tinkering can help alleviate the situation, but the base level of difficulty seems less forgiving than Alex Ferguson. \n \nAdd to this glitches such as substituted players seeming to reappear, goals being credited to the wrong player and the way certain teams (like Chelsea) seem unbeatable, and what could have been a life-consuming joy becomes an oddly addictive love-hate relationship, as your hopes are raised then dashed and still you come back for more (perhaps it should be called Football Fan Simulator?). \n \nUltimately, Championship Manager 2006 really is a game of two halves, one of which promises glory of Champions League proportions, while the other has a tendency to deliver conference fare. If next season's outing raises its game on the pitch, it really could be deserving of its 'championship' name. Right now, it remains a promising contender.", "id": 38459, "name": "Champ Manager 2006"}, {"genres": [9], "summary": "Select your favorite idol and match her in \"Paper Scissors Stone\".
