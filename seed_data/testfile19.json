It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game. \n \nSuper Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board.

Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area.

Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90\u00b0 turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/md6wvdyy8hccsqxqjz3t.jpg", "width": 2100, "cloudinary_id": "md6wvdyy8hccsqxqjz3t", "height": 1494}, "id": 42466, "name": "RPM Racing"}, {"genres": [8], "summary": "Shadow of the Best for SNES was never officially released.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yupac2xx3nmhklifgoom.jpg", "width": 1024, "cloudinary_id": "yupac2xx3nmhklifgoom", "height": 703}, "id": 42453, "name": "Super Shadow of the Beast"}, {"genres": [4], "summary": "It is the year After Colony 195, and war between the Space Colonies and Earth has begun.
