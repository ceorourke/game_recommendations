Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team's members. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. \n \nDepending on which character the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry are separated from the rest of the team during the chase and do not make it to the mansion.

Over the course of the game, the player character may encounter several members of Bravo Team, including Enrico Marini, the captain of the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant.

In the lab, the player encounters Wesker, who reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier, to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members.

After his death, his descendants and heirs assumed absolute political power over the region, forming the basis of the Holy Ashah Dynasty and ruling through a combination of religious doctrine and military power for millennia. The kings and queens of the Holy Ashah Dynasty, however, did not always rule wisely or justly, and, as time passed, the citizenry began to resent the power of their leaders.\nFifteen years ago, this growing discontent found its ultimate expression in the person of Arris the Sage, who united the disparate anti-royal factions throughout Sostegaria and shaped them into a powerful guerrilla army. Under the cunning leadership of Arris, this Liberation Army managed to outwit and outmaneuver the Royal Army, and finally smashed through to the palace of the Ashah Dynasty itself, and burnt it to the ground.\nWith the monarchy dissolved, the rebels establish a ruling council founded on the principles of democracy and popular sovereignty. From the ashes of the Holy Ashah Empire emerges the Republic of Ishtaria. The leaders of the revolution naturally assumed leadership positions within the new republic: all, that is, except for Arris himself, who suddenly disappeared and has not been seen of, nor heard of, ever since.\nToday, the fledgling republic is in increasingly dire straits: the autocratic Minister of Defense, Hel Spites, and his elite anti-terrorism squad, the Crimson Guard, are using ever-increasing force to stamp out the last vestiges of resistance to Ishtarian rule, while they allow outlaws to roam the countryside and pirates to sail the seas. Meanwhile, Ash Lambert and his colleagues at the third battalion of the Ishtarian Security Forces begin to suspect a conspiracy at the highest levels of government. Ash's attempts to draw attention to the situation, though, only draw the ire of the conspirators themselves, leaving only Ash and his allies to foil their plans and restore order to the nation.\nAfter the credits, an extra cutscene is available that shows Eleni hearing Ash's ocarina theme while claiming \"he\" has come back.", "id": 5561}, {"genres": [4, 5], "summary": "Get it on with Virtual On!

For 20,000 years mankind has expanded forth throughout the galaxy aided by a phenomenal invention known as the Warp Drive, which allows huge spatial distances to be traversed in a matter of hours. Under the auspices of the Emperor; a psychic so powerful he is essentially immortal, a pan-galactic Imperium has been established in which mankind has spread and prospered. The defenders of the Imperium are the Adeptus Astartes, or Space Marines, bio-genetically engineered warriors of superhuman prowess, ever vigilant to destroy the many threats that face mankind across the cosmos. \nThe player is one such Space Marine, belonging to one of the oldest and most honourable Chapters known as the Blood Angels, whose battle honours date back as long as the Imperium has existed. You have acquitted yourself well even among such heroic company, and it is thus that the player finds him/herself assigned to the Terminator company. Among the thousand warriors that compose a Space Marine Chapter, only the hundred most valorous and gifted brothers are deemed worthy enough of this honour. Terminators are the Chapter's ultimate warriors. Protected by this suit that makes them all but impervious to conventional weaponry, and armed with the most devastating weaponry available, Terminators stand in fear of no foe, no matter how potent. \nAmong the most insidious of mankind's enemies are Genestealers, a strange and terrifying alien race, reptilian in appearance, they are huge armoured six-limbed beasts, preternaturally swift and unbelievably ferocious in combat. A genestealer knows no fear, charging into combat irrespective of any threat to its life. Incredibly hard to kill and all too capable of inflicting death themselves, it is no surprise that Genestealers are considered one of the foremost threats to mankind's survival. However, there is another more frightening element to their nature: Genestealers are incapable of reproducing amongst themselves, and must rely on other races to expand their population. \nThe method they employ for this purpose is terrifying upon encountering a suitable host, such as a human being, a Genestealer will fix its piercing eyes upon it, mesmerising it much like a Terran snake does its prey. While the host is thus hypnotised, the Genestealer will extend its tongue, which contains a hollow, pointed tube known as the ovipositor in a gruesome parody of a kiss, depositing a small egg-like cell that contains the Genestealer's genetic profile. This cell behaves like a cancer, malignantly coursing through the host's system and altering its genetic profile. The victim shows little outward sign of the infection - in fact, he gains some of the 'Stealer's remarkable strength, resilience and longevity, becoming healthier than he was before. The effect is only really evident once the victim comes to reproduce. \nOnce they come to mate, the offspring of any victim is born as a Hybrid, a corrupt creature exhibiting characteristics of both Genestealer and host species. The Hybrid itself is equipped with an ovipositor, which it uses in a similar manner to its Purestrain parent. This cycle continues, with each new generation of Hybrid resembling the host species more closely. By the fourth generation, the offspring is barely detectable as alien save for a few give-away signs such as unnaturally sharp teeth and a purplish tinge to the skin. The offspring of this fourth generation is procreated in the conventional manner, and can result in either a Hybrid, a normal member of the host species or a Purestrain Genestealer, the only manner in which Purestrains can be produced. All the generations are linked in a psychic community, so Purestrains, Hybrids, and hosts all conceive of themselves as constituents of the same brood. \nThe manner in which Genestealers carry out their reproductive process is of exceptional danger to the Imperium, as whole planets can fall to the Genestealer threat; the affected humans look and act no different from normal, and the hosts are extremely secretive about the insidious curse they bear. Indeed the first an external agency may know about the presence of Genestealers is once a whole planet has been affected by the curse, requiring total cleansing and repopulation. Imperial authorities are thus extremely keen to terminate the Genestealer menace at source, before it has a chance to affect any nearby planet. \nThe prime manner in which Genestealer came into contact with humanity is through the use of Space Hulks. These are spaceships of human origin which have become lost in Warpspace, either through a malfunction of the ship's Warp Drive, or just as a consequence of travelling in a medium as uncertain as Warpspace. The human occupants having died, Genestealers and their Hybrid brood move in, settling down to hibernation until the drifting Space Hulk comes into contact with a species riper for infiltration and domination. \nSo thus, it is that whenever a Space Hulk is detected in the proximity of a human planet, the stalwart warriors of the Space Marines are detached to rid the Hulk of its Genestealer cargo, preventing any chance of another planet falling victim to the Genestealer curse. Such is the combat prowess of the Genestealer that only the Terminator squads have met with any success. That is the player's status and this is the player's mission: rid the galaxy of the Genestealer menace once and for all.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nfomjdsvkp90qglaipws.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "nfomjdsvkp90qglaipws", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/glxlsaxdcvqhbji7ylip.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "glxlsaxdcvqhbji7ylip", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hqctrjoenrkvee0abdnr.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "hqctrjoenrkvee0abdnr", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pjratxu1uwzuwuxtg533.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "pjratxu1uwzuwuxtg533", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pj3dhjqromjbubtlwmre.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "pj3dhjqromjbubtlwmre", "height": 480}], "id": 4330}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/euynza4stomeylbegibu.jpg", "width": 1525, "cloudinary_id": "euynza4stomeylbegibu", "height": 2151}, "id": 45469, "name": "Heir of Zendor"}, {"genres": [14], "summary": "When the game is on the line, you need blistering service returns, ball hammering ground strokes and an impenetrable net game.

Nothing electronic could reach it, making the investigation a difficult one. One year later, the U.N. ceased the investigation, claiming the ruins were from the Maya civilization. They named the ruins \"Lanfront Ruins\" and the pyramid \"Temple of the Moon\".\n\nThree years after this, Doctor Albert W. Wily, now working together with Doctor Thomas Light, went to investigate the ruins because the electromagnetic field started increasing, this being a good chance to clear his name. A few days later, Wily uncovered an ancient alien super computer inside the temple, Ra Moon, which revived his various Robot Masters from Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 by analyzing the information about them in Dr. Wily's laptop. Wily thought it would be a great chance to conquer the world.\n\nThree weeks after Wily found Ra Moon, the electromagnetic field begins to affect all the machinery and electronics around the world. Roll falls into a coma victim of the electromagnetic field, and Wily makes a worldwide broadcast saying to the world surrender for him in two weeks, or else he will shut down all machinery, which would effectively kill Roll and all the robots around the world, and without them, humans would die as well. Dr. Light quickly immunizes Mega Man and his brothers (the Robot Masters from Mega Man 1: Cut Man, Elec Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, Bomb Man, and Guts Man) from the electromagnetic field, and sends them to stop Dr. Wily before it's too late. During the adventure, Mega Man and his comrades fought their way to the source of Electromagnetic field, Ra Moon, battling the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2 and 3 in the process. In the end, Mega Man manages to destroy Ra Moon and the electromagnetic field ceases, Roll recovers and all the machinery around the world starts functioning again.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qwwrhhaxrpbabpmpcelx.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "qwwrhhaxrpbabpmpcelx", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uu1h74wttlmouby4su7r.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "uu1h74wttlmouby4su7r", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nv0cv9cb9g3qijdngtnn.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "nv0cv9cb9g3qijdngtnn", "height": 240}], "id": 1732}, {"genres": [4, 33], "name": "Dead or Alive", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xlwqewbr9mkkddq9pnoe.jpg", "width": 534, "cloudinary_id": "xlwqewbr9mkkddq9pnoe", "height": 627}, "summary": "Dead or Alive is a fighting game and the first entry in Team Ninja's long-running Dead or Alive series.

Released in 1994, it was developed and produced by Sega. A well-received home port was released on the Sega Saturn in 1995, scoring mainly positive reviews for its arcade faithful conversion, due to the similar hardware of the ST-V arcade and the Saturn. It was released on the PlayStation 2 in Japan only as part of the Sega Ages 2500 series. Compared to other decathlon based games, Decathlete has a more comic and cartoon like style. A sequel followed in 1997, the winter sports based Winter Heat. \n \nThe game play is largely based on quick repeated button pressing for gaining speed, and timed single button presses for jumping and releasing projectiles, in a similar style to the 1983 Konami release, Track & Field. The game differed with a slightly more advanced control system and 3-D graphics. \n \nThe player must select one of eight international fictitious athletes. In the arcade version, the player competes in ten traditional decathlon events, requiring a minimum set time, height or distance to qualify from one event to the next.

During a quest to seek a cure for his ill aunt, he travels to a strange island out at sea, where he meets a fairy named Zhao Ling'er(\u8d75\u7075\u513f). He is forced to marry her and remain on the island forever, but manages to escape home with the cure for his aunt. However, he loses memory of his adventure on the island and does not remember Zhao when he meets her again.

They learn that Zhao is actually a half-serpent spirit and has been imprisoned inside the Demon Prison Tower(\u9501\u5996\u5854) by the sect's elders. Li and Lin break into the tower and succeed in rescuing Zhao after making a perilous descent to its lowest level, but suffer grave injuries when the tower collapses on itself during their escape.\n\nThe trio are saved by a herbal medicine guru, who tells Li that Zhao is pregnant with his child, and that Lin has died from her wounds. Li is deeply saddened but he has a more important task to do, which is, to retrieve two rare items to save Zhao and his baby's lives. During his quest, he meets and befriends A'nu(\u963f\u5974), a white Miao(\u82d7\u65cf) princess. They are currently in southwestern China, where the Miao people live. The land is plagued by a prolonged drought and the white and black Miao are at war over scarce resources. Li completes his mission and Zhao recovers, after which she calls for a rainstorm and restores peace to the land. They discover that the drought is orchestrated by an evil black Miao cleric. Li, Zhao and A'nu confront him and manage to defeat him after a battle, but Zhao sacrifices herself to destroy a monster summoned by the cleric.\n\nLi is traumatized by the loss of his two close friends, who are also his love interests.

Like in Snatcher, the game features shooting segments where the player must defend their character from incoming enemies. The player can use the shooting trainer at the police department to test their reflex and accuracy.

It also featured a theme revolving around space exploration and occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to Snatcher, but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments.

He is found alive and well 25 years later thanks to the cold-sleep module connected to the suit. Three years later, Jonathan (now a private investigator working in the former Los Angeles) is visited by his former wife, Lorraine who asks for Jonathan's help in solving the disappearance of her current husband, Kenzo Hojo, the only clues he left behind being a torn leaf, a set of capsules, and the word \"Plato\". Jonathan is reluctant to take her case at first, but after Lorraine leaves his office, she is attacked and murdered by a man in a black motorcycle suit. Jonathan, unable to catch the culprit, decides to fulfill his ex-wife's final request and travels to Beyond, where he is reunited with his former partner from his LAPD days, Ed Brown who agrees to help Jonathan investigate the circumstances surrounding Hojo's disappearance and Lorraine's murder.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Jonathan and Ed learn that Becker and Tokugawa have been involved in running an illegal drug and organ trafficking ring in order to counteract the negative side-effects of being in space for long periods of time. Hojo had been included in the business in order to save his daughter, Karen, and ultimately wanted to leave, only to be murdered.

This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father. \n \nJulian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny. \n \nScenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 & 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some \"overlap\". Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqujkv9kgwqpz1kxzwnd.jpg", "width": 1424, "cloudinary_id": "dqujkv9kgwqpz1kxzwnd", "height": 1397}, "id": 46061, "name": "Shining Force III: 3rd Scenario"}, {"genres": [14], "summary": "Athlete Kings is a conversion of the 1995 Sega coin-op Decathlete in which you get to compete in all 10 events involved in a Decathlon.

Together with his partner Agent G, they arrive on the scene at the Curien Mansion, amidst a series of ominous occurrences and disappearances at the mansion, to immediately discover the estate overrun with hellish creations. A mortally wounded man gives them a small field journal showing information of all of Curien's deadly creations and their weak points. It is used every time the player(s) are confronted by a boss. \n \nCurien was obsessed with discovering the nature of life and death, supported by the DBR Corporation and its own team of scientists. However, Curien's relentless pursuit of this goal led him to grow insane, with his behavior growing more erratic and the nature of his experiments beginning to take a gruesome turn. Curien's plan for his research ultimately resulted in the release of his experimental subjects into the world. Wasting no time, they storm inside the mansion in order to find and save Sophie. Witnessing first-hand the terror unleashed by Curien's abominations, and after Sophie suffers life-threatening injuries as a result, Rogan and G go further inside the mansion and lab of Curien to bring him to justice, uncovering the nature behind his research in the process. \n \nAmidst the chaos wrought by Curien, Rogan and \"G\" face many formidable foes, including The Chariot, an undead, armour-clad, neo-warrior wielding a bardiche who mortally wounds Rogan's fianc\u00e9e Sophie Richards before the player faces him in battle, and The Hanged Man, a winged gargoyle/bat-like creature. The Hanged Man captures Sophie in the game's opening stage before stealing away over the mansion. In the Third chapter, the AMS agents confront Curien, who releases The Hermit, an eight-legged spider-like creature that spits balls of web upon them, allowing Curien to escape to his lab. \n \nUpon confronting Curien a second time, the AMS agents are to encounter his masterpiece, The Magician, a humanoid demon-esque creature, which possesses a mastery of fire. After Curien releases the creature from its incubation chamber, the Magician reveals itself to be self-aware, refusing to serve any master and Dr. Curien is killed by his creation. To prevent the Magician from escaping the mansion and destroying the world, Rogan and 'G' confront the creature in one final battle. They succeed in destroying Curien's monster and are then given one last, chilling warning from the Magician. \n \nThe Magician explodes.
