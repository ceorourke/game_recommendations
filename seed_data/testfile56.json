Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bu8i25u0uq8ox6z0qtl4.jpg", "width": 1597, "cloudinary_id": "bu8i25u0uq8ox6z0qtl4", "height": 593}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/afxnkwiui69yguivj1hz.jpg", "width": 1597, "cloudinary_id": "afxnkwiui69yguivj1hz", "height": 595}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lyskemijakvnqjskqjwr.jpg", "width": 1589, "cloudinary_id": "lyskemijakvnqjskqjwr", "height": 597}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mj6da1cjceuwgdxkehkc.jpg", "width": 1593, "cloudinary_id": "mj6da1cjceuwgdxkehkc", "height": 595}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lhao0eiwy3m12kfqkhh2.jpg", "width": 1595, "cloudinary_id": "lhao0eiwy3m12kfqkhh2", "height": 597}], "id": 1428}, {"genres": [8, 9, 32], "name": "Toki Tori", "videos": [{"video_id": "g4CfoNdfZww", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/guokxzcf8upowyj1rozb.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "guokxzcf8upowyj1rozb", "height": 256}, "summary": "In Toki Tori, the player controls a little yellow chicken determined to save all the lost eggs.

However, in the game's second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya's case and has established himself as a \"genius\" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix's assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a \"Spirit Medium\" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth's father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred's perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred's cover-up and achieve a \"not guilty\" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train. \nThe fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema's scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xh64jlnicza83gitsxgg.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "xh64jlnicza83gitsxgg", "height": 360}], "id": 1426}, {"genres": [5, 33], "name": "Fast Draw Showdown", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lxjtn3sq8rwu9ipxyjvo.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "lxjtn3sq8rwu9ipxyjvo", "height": 332}, "summary": "When it comes to fast draw there're only two types of people: the quick\u2026and the dead!", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nj6tfh44ry4aupslyuab.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "nj6tfh44ry4aupslyuab", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z6jifdbngvtmb2kut7v9.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "z6jifdbngvtmb2kut7v9", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pqrmfos4tajkj9pwikh4.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "pqrmfos4tajkj9pwikh4", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ewqwlrrtlvvliswenh0h.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "ewqwlrrtlvvliswenh0h", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xjzmfhagbqwdyemjnlhx.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "xjzmfhagbqwdyemjnlhx", "height": 1080}], "id": 8927}, {"genres": [4, 14], "summary": "It's Little Mac vs. Doc Louis!!
