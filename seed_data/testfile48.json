Utilizing the power of the next generation consoles, and building off the critically-acclaimed NHL Collision Physics system, every player on the ice is governed by physics at all times. Feel the hard-hitting chaos of NHL hockey through true-to-life secondary collisions, net scrambles and player pileups, capturing the desperation of every shift. \n \nREAL PUCK PHYSICS \nThe puck is one of the most complex items in the game to authentically replicate and it finally gets its due in NHL 15. Completely rebuilt puck physics result in a more realistic feel to every puck interaction. Everything on the ice, including the ice surface itself, is live which leads to the unpredictable and authentic puck spins, rolls and bounces seen in a real NHL game. \n \nAUTHENTIC PLAYER & EQUIPMENT MODELS \nThe Next Generation Hockey Player has been rebuilt from the ice up. Now player models have three distinct layers - the body, equipment, and jersey. Each layer interacts independently, making every contact with the puck or other players even more realistic. Dynamic Cloth technology adds an extra layer of realism as it reacts to the player\u2019s movement as they explode up the ice, helping bring the speed of the game to life. \n \nUNPRECEDENTED PLAYER LIKENESS \nPowered by the same technology that brought the most realistic representation of the athlete to EA SPORTS UFC, NHL 15 delivers groundbreaking player likeness, emotion and animation. From the strides a player takes to get up the ice to the emotion on their face after scoring a game winning goal, the players are as real as they\u2019ve ever been. \n \nSUPERSTAR SKILL STICK \nNow all the tools of an NHL superstar are in your hands. The revolutionary Skill Stick has evolved to give even more control to the player. Protect the puck, receive passes without breaking stride, and discover an arsenal of sweet new dekes, all with an intuitive right stick control scheme that is easy to use but packed with depth. \n \nAUTHENTIC ARENAS \nThere is no feeling like being there, and we are giving you the best seats in the house. The power of the next-gen consoles finally allows the NHL franchise to capture every detail of an NHL arena. Unique arena elements from 19,000+ seat capacities to lighting and player entrance tunnels are captured with a level of detail not possible on the previous generation. Now those home games will truly feel like home. \n \nNEW COMMENTARY TEAM \nNew voices for a new generation. NHL 15 welcomes the NBC Sports commentary team of Mike 'Doc' Emrick and Eddie Olczyk to the broadcast booth. TSN analyst Ray Ferraro will provide game insights at ice level. Combined with Real Life Broadcast Integration that will feature real-world pre-game video commentary with Doc and Eddie set against in-game visuals, NHL 15 takes a revolutionary step forward in sports videogames; where the lines between the real world of sport broadcast and the game are blurred. \n \nNBC SPORTS GAME DAY PRESENTATION \nThe most realistic broadcast package in a video game to-date is possible because of a new partnership with NBC Sports. Set the scene with the NHL on NBC crew welcoming you to the city during the game intros and immerse yourself in an experience that matches what you see on television with NHL on NBC graphics and branding. \n \nLIVING CROWDS \nNHL 15 sets a new standard in videogames with over 9,000 individual crowd models with 4x the animations of previous generations. Take a look through the glass and you\u2019ll see fans hold up signs with your name on them, costume wearing superfans, or even sections full of team rivals rooting against you.

Barret, the group's leader, believes the Mako energy the reactors consume to be the planet's lifeblood, and Shinra's reactors are killing the planet. Cloud's childhood friend, Tifa, is also in the group. Although the first mission is successful, AVALANCHE is ambushed at the next reactor during a subsequent raid. When the reactor explodes, Cloud drops down into Midgar's slums. He is found by Aerith (aka Aeris), a girl he briefly met selling flowers after his first mission with AVALANCHE. Prompted by the arrival of the Turks, who have been sent to capture Aerith, Cloud agrees to act as her bodyguard and defends her from their assault. Meanwhile, Shinra learns the location of AVALANCHE's hideout in Sector 7, and subsequently destroys it by dropping the upper plate of Sector 7 onto the slums, killing its population. The Turks also capture Aerith, who is revealed to be the last surviving \"Cetra\", an ancient near-dead tribe closely attuned with the planet. President Shinra and Professor Hojo believe Aerith is the key to finding the \"Promised Land\", a mythical land of fertility they see as an abundant source of Mako. The remaining AVALANCHE members - Cloud, Barret and Tifa - infiltrate Shinra to rescue Aerith, in the process encountering a specimen simply labeled \"Jenova\". Joined by Red XIII, a sentient tiger-like creature on whom Hojo had been conducting experiments, the party rescues Aerith, but is captured by the Turks while trying to escape and detained within the building. In the morning, they find their cells open and most of the personnel, including President Shinra, killed: the perpetrator appears to be Sephiroth, a legendary SOLDIER leader who was presumed dead several years ago.The group discovers that the Jenova specimen is also missing, presumed stolen by Sephiroth. \n \nWhile the president's son, Rufus Shinra, assumes control of the company, the party leaves Midgar and pursues Sephiroth across the planet. They are joined by Cait Sith, a cat-robot secretly controlled by repentant Turk Reeve Tuesti; Yuffie Kisaragi, a teenage ninja from Wutai; Vincent Valentine, a former Turk; and Cid Highwind, a chain-smoking pilot. At a Cetra temple, the party encounters Sephiroth, who reveals his plan: if the world is significantly damaged, the Lifestream, made of pure Mako energy, will gather in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth intends to use the legendary Black Materia to cast a spell called \"Meteor\" to cause a massive injury, enabling him to merge with the planet's Mako energy and be reborn as a god. The party drives off Sephiroth, acquiring the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into giving him the Materia. While the party recovers from the encounter, Aerith sets off to stop Sephiroth on her own, following him to an ancient Cetra city. The party follows, and finds Aerith praying to the planet for aid. Just as they reach her, Sephiroth kills her. Cloud and his allies track Sephiroth to the North Crater. During their journey, they find out that Jenova is an interstellar creature who crashed on the planet roughly two thousand years ago, intent on taking over completely. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called Weapons. While most humans fled, the Cetra managed to defeat Jenova and entomb its remains. A few decades before the present, the remains of Jenova were unearthed by Professor Gast, a researcher for Shinra. Mistaking Jenova for a Cetra, Gast attempted to clone Jenova, assisted by Hojo. Even though Gast abandoned the project, Hojo successfully managed to use his assistant's unborn child for the experiment: the baby was Sephiroth. Approximately five years before the present day, while on a Shinra mission with Cloud to Cloud's and Tifa's hometown of Nibelheim, Sephiroth encountered Hojo's failed test subjects and learned of his origins. Mistakenly believing that Jenova and he were Cetra, he was driven insane and destroyed Nibelheim as an act of vengeance on the normal human population. Cloud and Tifa confronted Sephiroth during the massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished, presumed dead until his reappearance in the present day. \n \nWhen the party reaches the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth for killing Aerith, they learn that Sephiroth was one of multiple Jenova clones that Hojo had created from both animals and humans. Upon reaching Sephiroth, who has been killing and absorbing the Jenova clones to instigate a \"Reunion\" of Jenova's cells, he manipulates Cloud into helping him cast Meteor, then states that Cloud is one of Sephiroth's clones, showing him memories of the Nibelheim incident with a black-haired SOLDIER in Cloud's place. The summoning of Meteor activates the planet's Weapons, and during the subsequent earthquake, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream. The rest of the party and the Turks that had followed them to the Crater escape on the airship, the Highwind, where the party members are placed under arrest. As Meteor approaches the planet, the Weapons turn on humanity in an attempt to return as much Mako energy to the Lifestream as possible to aid the planet. Shinra focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the Weapons and attempting to destroy Meteor directly, which eventually costs the lives of the majority of Shinra's personnel.[31] Tifa, Barret and the others are sentenced to be executed, but escape. They find a catatonic Cloud at a hospital in a tropical resort, where he washed up following the events at the North Crater. Tifa stays behind to help Cloud recover, while the rest of the party continue their fight against Shinra. An attack by the Weapons destroys the island, and Cloud and Tifa both fall into the Lifestream. There, Tifa helps Cloud reconstruct his memories and learns the truth about his past. \n \nIt is revealed that Cloud was not accepted into SOLDIER, and that the SOLDIER in Sephiroth's visions was Aerith's first love and Cloud's friend, Zack Fair. The two were present during the Nibelheim incident, with Cloud managing to fatally wound Sephiroth, who only survived through Jenova's cells: Zack and Cloud were severely wounded and later taken and used by Hojo to perfect his SOLDIER and Jenova experiments. Zack tried escaping with Cloud but was killed by Shinra soldiers. Cloud recovered, took Zack's sword and made his way to Midgar: Cloud's own aspirations to SOLDIER and Zack's memories and stories combined, with the help of the Jenova treatment, to create a false personality. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud is able to recover. After Cloud and Tifa emerge from the Lifestream, the party regroup and learn that Aerith, in her final moments, was attempting to use the White Materia to cast the spell \"Holy\", the only means of opposing Meteor. It turns out she was successful in casting the spell, but Sephiroth has been preventing its release. The group decide to first stop the rampage of the Weapons. Alongside this, the party confront Hojo, revealed to be Sephiroth's father, as the scientist attempts to aid his son by feeding Mako energy to him. After mutating himself with Jenova cells, he is killed in combat. After this, they launch their final assault on Sephiroth, who is defeated by Cloud after a series of battles. The party escapes from the crater as Holy is released. Holy attempts to block Meteor under Midgar, but Meteor has drawn too close for Holy to combat it alone. Just before Meteor's impact, the Lifestream rises from the planet to aid Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fl2gkx16ktwodnselstq.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "fl2gkx16ktwodnselstq", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o8rqjwb1fax2miipu1ih.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "o8rqjwb1fax2miipu1ih", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/knbkthshgapzkk7kxged.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "knbkthshgapzkk7kxged", "height": 320}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/arj49w9no0mvpleohp3r.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "arj49w9no0mvpleohp3r", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/curbnfb7dxvklfdrp5yz.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "curbnfb7dxvklfdrp5yz", "height": 1080}], "id": 427}, {"genres": [13], "name": "Air Conflicts: Secret Wars Ultimate Edition", "videos": [{"video_id": "VTaMmCtcRss", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k45ichbu7ujwi3w4c4nw.jpg", "width": 475, "cloudinary_id": "k45ichbu7ujwi3w4c4nw", "height": 593}, "summary": "Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flight simulation game that takes you right into the heart of the action, with air combat at historical locations set in World War I and II.

Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing about action-packed mecha on mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: Gunpla aka Gundam Model Kits! For those new to this specific spin-off, the core mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own Gundam based on the many real life parts featured in the game; the previous title, Gundam Breaker 2, included over 100 Gunpla kits to choose form, which massively increased the number of options and customizations available to a total of over 10,000,000,000 different options! Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own! The SD (Super Deformed) series of Gundam will now also be available in support roles, who will take instructions from the player during battles. SD Gundams can only be set to \"Module,\" the effects of which will extend to the full team. A new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rzcxw2ebmbodoqamnqsy.jpg", "width": 1831, "cloudinary_id": "rzcxw2ebmbodoqamnqsy", "height": 880}], "id": 19858}, {"genres": [25], "name": "God of War III: Remastered", "videos": [{"video_id": "qKogMfIAAkY", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yx6yrtaxgdcpapjbzjj9.jpg", "width": 450, "cloudinary_id": "yx6yrtaxgdcpapjbzjj9", "height": 560}, "summary": "Set in the realm of brutal Greek mythology, God of War III Remastered is the critically acclaimed single-player game that allows players to take on the fearless role of the ex-Spartan warrior, Kratos, as he rises from the darkest depths of Hades to scale the very heights of Mount Olympus to seek his bloody revenge.

Discover a wondrous world full of whimsical characters, charming puzzles and perilous dangers in this fun and enchanting coming of age story.", "storyline": "The prologue begins with Graham entering a thicket and heading to a scary Forest Well. It is a linear sequence which has a twenty-something King Graham returning to the Forest Well (from a previous adventure) on a quest from King Edward to find his stolen Magic Mirror, while trying to avoid the Legendary Beast, a dragon living there. He discovers the cave filled with beds and other strange traps. He finds a bookcase with spellbooks and selfhelp guides on how to capture and control dragons. Finally using a feeding mechanism, he is able to distract the dragon, and take the mirror. After a perilous escape, he return to castle to present the Mirror to the king.   \n   \nThe main story returns to a time earlier, when Graham was a teenager, traveling to Daventry for the first time to take part in a Knight Tournament there, and recounts his first journey into the Forest Well, and encounter with the beast within, and the loss of a friend.   \n   \nGraham begins on an overlook above Daventry, riding in on his noble steed Triumph, when he falls down the hill until he reaches the Back Road below. He follows a sign leading him a missing bridge, and the Parade of Hopeful Knights marching past beyond. He makes a detour down more of the backroads, until he find the Merchant of Miracles, who sends him to repair his wagon wheel. Graham cuts down a tree, finds his way into town, where he has the choice between three different items from each of the three closed shops, and a choice to tip one of the three shops a swell.   \n   \nAfter helping the merchant, and after being cheated (either choosing to buy a fake initiation ticket, or having his coins stolen), he is brought to the Tournament Theatre, but finds that the bridge is out again. He tricks the royal guard to save him from drowning, and then distracts them with bees so he can join up with the other knight initiates. He tries to figure out a way to cross the river, but each knight ends up stealing his solutions, until only he and Manny are left on the side of the river. After figuring out a final solution, he makes it across the river, while Manny just walks across the river. On the other side Manny congratulates Graham, and convinces him to have a secret alliance. Graham finally makes it to the tournament, after explaining why he was late, he has to makeup the Chivalry Test in which he has to learn a bit about each initiate.   \n   \nAll knight hopefuls are then given an initiation quest to find the eye of a hideous beast. There are multiple solutions to this quest, but it cannot be from cute furry creatures. Graham meets Amaya Blackstone on his way back into the heart of Daventry, who gives him some of the history of the Kingdom, and invites him to meet her at her shop in the town. Graham meets all the town members including a compassionate baker, and wise Hobblepots who run a curiosity/magic/alchemy shop. He learns that someone is stealing the beds in the kingdom.   \n   \nDepending on his actions at this point he might discover the Forest Well for the first time, a local landmark that everyone knows about, and is used as a kind of testing ground for knights hoping to rise up in the ranks of the Royal Guard to prove themselves to King Edward. He either loses a friend there, Achaka, and receives an eye from the Legendary Beast there, or escapes without one (but given extra eye by Manny). Or he might befriend the Bridge Troll Olfie, who helps him out, or use trickery to make a substitute eye to submit to the judging knights.   \n   \nFollowing the initiation, the knights then must finish three trials; Duel of Strength, Duel of Speed, and the Championship Duel of Wits. Depending on where he went previous quest, he might be sent to find lost knight who has disappeared from the competition (if he hadn't discovered him in the previous quest). Regardless of when this takes place it leads him to the Forest Well (and results in the same situation, he learns how to shoot a bow, his friend dies, and Graham escapes with or without the beast's eye). In both cases Graham encounters Manny who convinces him to stay in the competition, and that he must do it for the memory of Achaka.   \n   \nGraham defeats the various competing knights at each duel, in order to join the Knights of Daventry, and gain the chance to become King of Daventry as well. However getting to each deed requires him to help other citizens of Daventry, befriend the trolls, help the Merchant of Miracles again or let him get captured by goblins, discover other secrets of the land, find new mysteries. While doing this he learns that goblins are behind stealing the beds, but doesn't know why. He defeats Acorn in the Duel of Strength, with the help of the trolls and Manny, defeats the fast knight Whisper in the duel of speed, and finally has a battle of wits with Manny. Manny has been secretly manipulating the entire tournament behind the scenes, and has ulterior motives to become king. During the game he uses hypnosis potion on Graham, which forces Graham to make the moves Manny wants him to. The dark knight explains his reasons, and plans for ruling the kingdom. His story about Achaka changes from what he had said before (suggesting much of it might have been a lie), he seems to know a bit too much about the goblins as well. The rest of the Royal Guard do not trust him, and prevent him from winning the duel so that he cannot become king, and to give Graham extra chances. Finally Graham defeats the knight by either winning fairly or by cheating. But Manny attempts to kill Graham in revenge, forcing Graham to defend himself (with items offered by the town's citizens). He defends himself, and then force the evil knight to leave (but Manny threatens to take revenge).   \n   \nIn the present, Gwendolyn is listening these stories as she prepares for her own fencing tournament with her cousin Gart. The choices Graham made in his stories influences how she reacts and treats her cousin. She is either kind to him, sneaky, or quick to attack.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wypjqkaw9ngirsn5l3ue.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "wypjqkaw9ngirsn5l3ue", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vy0nfh9xbaprhdkwzasu.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "vy0nfh9xbaprhdkwzasu", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ftwcslfg10vesiulgi2h.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "ftwcslfg10vesiulgi2h", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mhfadd7mopv1qtiny7z3.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "mhfadd7mopv1qtiny7z3", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a926qt07krl02vaqnymz.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "a926qt07krl02vaqnymz", "height": 1080}], "id": 28048}, {"genres": [31, 32], "name": "Late Shift", "videos": [{"video_id": "XlfCRV1j_v4", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dzhnblrsf6l63iiamea2.jpg", "width": 1500, "cloudinary_id": "dzhnblrsf6l63iiamea2", "height": 2121}, "summary": "Late Shift is a high stakes FMV crime thriller.

The player takes on the role of a sheriff's deputy who is sent to Hope County to arrest Seed.

The residents of Hope County opposed to Seed include Pastor Jerome, a local church leader that has seen his congregation taken by Eden's Gate; Mary May, a bartender whose father was murdered by the cult; and Nick Rye, a cropduster pilot who wants to eliminate the influence of the cult in order to build a better future for his children.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xeqtlwx9f80ekqiyh25w.jpg", "width": 783, "cloudinary_id": "xeqtlwx9f80ekqiyh25w", "height": 440}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b2k0cvfbzprnuizutgow.jpg", "width": 783, "cloudinary_id": "b2k0cvfbzprnuizutgow", "height": 440}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u5ldoak74o1yhl2gt6y7.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "u5ldoak74o1yhl2gt6y7", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xrbujdrkuyta8cneqipz.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "xrbujdrkuyta8cneqipz", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ikk26u9j3qpug39snuoj.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "ikk26u9j3qpug39snuoj", "height": 1080}], "id": 28552}, {"genres": [31, 32], "name": "The Fall Part 2: Unbound", "videos": [{"video_id": "vDR6z73gLZc", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "TzPnKOuE3F0", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vf35mmma9yacvvlfsuoc.jpg", "width": 1517, "cloudinary_id": "vf35mmma9yacvvlfsuoc", "height": 796}, "summary": "Continue ARID's journey of self discovery as she's thrust into a challenging and bizarre adventure that will test your wits as a player.

Out of the four stages in the game, the first, second and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of small fry enemies: one with fewer hit points and a stronger attack (usually armed with a weapon) and one with more hit points, but with a weaker attack and the ability to grab the player from behind, making him vulnerable to other enemies' attacks. \n \nWhen only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss is defeated, any remaining enemies retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down, and brings in the normal enemies once the bikers have been defeated. The third stage is a gang of women; their boss is a very large woman who cannot easily be knocked to the ground. The fourth stage features a single type of knife-wielding enemy who can kill the player with one hit. Once the player has defeated this first wave of enemies, the main character proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next cycle with an increased difficulty. \n \nIn addition to an eight-direction joystick, there are three buttons; left attack, right attack, and jump. Pressing the attack in the direction the character is facing will punch, while attacking in the opposite direction will perform a rear kick. Jumping, followed immediately by one of the attack buttons, which will perform a jumping kick in the direction of the attack. \n \nPressing the joystick twice quickly either left or right will cause the player to run, at which point attacking in the direction of the run will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and attacking in the opposite direction will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a downed enemy will make the player sit on top of the enemy, at which point attacking toward the enemy will cause the player to pummel him. The bosses can only be sat on if all normal enemies have been defeated, and unless the boss' energy level is low enough, he'll throw the player off.", "storyline": "In Renegade, the player controls a vigilante (named Mr. K in the NES version), who fights a variety of street gangs on his way to save his girlfriend.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wlp6fauavsdvbmrsozto.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "wlp6fauavsdvbmrsozto", "height": 200}], "id": 6852}, {"genres": [31], "name": "Fated: The Silent Oath", "videos": [{"video_id": "UL0zpbN-R1Y", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jfjuv9rjwrhibp5q8txs.jpg", "width": 1440, "cloudinary_id": "jfjuv9rjwrhibp5q8txs", "height": 1440}, "summary": "FATED is a first-person movie-length narrative-adventure game in virtual reality.

This is a land of buried secrets, lost technology, fearsome lunatics, and deadly factions. No one here has ever heard of the Desert Rangers. Your reputation is yours to build from scratch, and your choices may save this land or doom it. With a renewed focus on macro-reactivity, you\u2019ll be picking between warring factions, deciding whether locations are destroyed or saved, and making other far reaching decisions that have a marked impact on the shape of your world. \n \n- A party-based role-playing game, with a renewed focus on our trademark complex story reactivity and strategic combat. \n- By including vehicles, environmental dangers, and a revamped, more fluid action system, we are evolving on Wasteland 2's deep tactical turn-based combat and unique encounter design. \n- Play by yourself or with a friend in story-driven synchronous or asynchronous multiplayer. Choices open up (or close off) mission opportunities, areas to explore, story arcs, and lots of other content. \n- Your Ranger Base is a core part of the experience. As you help the local people and establish a reputation in Colorado, quests and narrative will force you to make decisions on how to lead. \n- The game will be set in the savage lands of frozen Colorado, where survival is difficult and a happy outcome is never guaranteed. Players will face difficult moral choices and make sacrifices that will change the game world. \n- Wasteland 3 will feature a deep and engaging story utilizing a newly-revamped dialog tree system from the celebrated writers of Torment: Tides of Numenera. \n- Simultaneously releasing to Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.", "storyline": "\"You push yourself from the ground. Biting wind claws at your eyes, your throat. \n \nEvery inch of your body hurts, but you are alive. Your squadmates are not. They lie motionless, frozen beneath the bloody snow. You will join them if you don\u2019t get out of this storm. \n \nA light flickers in the howling dark, over a distant hill. Wincing, you set off towards it.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ur7rm3sjp8swrlwq4ova.jpg", "width": 6000, "cloudinary_id": "ur7rm3sjp8swrlwq4ova", "height": 3375}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rrh39fr9foyprhfoarlt.jpg", "width": 6000, "cloudinary_id": "rrh39fr9foyprhfoarlt", "height": 3375}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l6bjvjowdzmlgunmnpyo.jpg", "width": 4000, "cloudinary_id": "l6bjvjowdzmlgunmnpyo", "height": 2250}], "id": 24863}, {"genres": [2], "name": "Iwaihime: Matsuri", "videos": [{"video_id": "D7qBfltQ96Q", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ykja96md5wo23latd5cu.jpg", "width": 370, "cloudinary_id": "ykja96md5wo23latd5cu", "height": 353}, "summary": "A port of the visual novel Iwaihime from PC to Playstation 4 and Vita.  \nIt will include new scenarios.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g9kjciouu5wmqepdu5l6.jpg", "width": 610, "cloudinary_id": "g9kjciouu5wmqepdu5l6", "height": 343}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wax9un5ypjacavfybgba.jpg", "width": 610, "cloudinary_id": "wax9un5ypjacavfybgba", "height": 343}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qnhnhkbfmyct6zazvf31.jpg", "width": 610, "cloudinary_id": "qnhnhkbfmyct6zazvf31", "height": 343}], "id": 28291}, {"genres": [5, 8, 9, 32], "name": "Mighty Switch Force!

The aim of the game is to explore underground tunnels, gathering as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps and enemies. The spelunker can whip or jump on enemies to defeat them, pick up items that can be thrown to either attack enemies or set off traps, and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to navigate the caves. Levels are randomly generated and grouped into four increasingly difficult \"areas\", each with a distinctive set of items, enemies, terrain types and special features. Later areas contain better treasures, secret locations, and items. However, if the player loses all their hearts or runs into an instant kill trap, they will have to start from the beginning. \n \n \nEnemies include animals like bats, snakes and spiders of varying sizes, other characters, and monsters like yeti, man-eating plants and ghosts. The player can collect many items, mainly gold and jewels which add to the player's score, but also useful objects including bombs, guns, climbing gear and archaeological artifacts. Some of the latter have supernatural abilities, including kapalas, hedjets, crystal skulls and golden ankhs, though many of these special items can only be gained through secret methods, like combining other items together. Some items may be purchased or stolen from shops scattered about the caves, though the shopkeeper becomes a powerful enemy if you steal from him. \n \n \nThe player can also encounter damsels in distress trapped in the caves, who can be picked up and carried to an exit. Successfully doing so returns health to the player. It's possible to unlock the damsel as a playable character; gameplay is identical, except that the player encounters spelunkers to rescue. Another unlockable character is the \"Tunnel Man\", who possesses a mattock instead of a whip. \n \n \nThe Xbox Live Arcade version of the game features local multiplayer (co-op and deathmatch) for up to four players. There are 9 different characters to play as. \n \n \nSpelunky also includes a level editor, in which players can create their own non-random levels to share with others.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jcp8odbymhh6exidv1ev.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "jcp8odbymhh6exidv1ev", "height": 544}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iyydvheenwo5ftsb6dse.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "iyydvheenwo5ftsb6dse", "height": 544}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mwt9kanz0ahs755liln6.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "mwt9kanz0ahs755liln6", "height": 544}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kmz2lzgrj4aijosc6ptf.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "kmz2lzgrj4aijosc6ptf", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mrkcq2ahpvbunklcyqv2.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "mrkcq2ahpvbunklcyqv2", "height": 360}], "id": 3029}, {"genres": [12], "name": "Dragon Quest X", "videos": [{"video_id": "KZFlz2zHLLY", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xhz4muakv5ovxvzypni1.jpg", "width": 559, "cloudinary_id": "xhz4muakv5ovxvzypni1", "height": 844}, "summary": "Dragon Quest X is a subscription based MMORPG, originally released for the Wii, in the Dragon Quest universe.

The game's prominent characters are the \"Verse Maidens\", an idol group with the power to fight off the Beep. These powers are used to fight the Beep and save mankind, by giving them hope and dreams. The members of the Verse Maidens are Otoha, Kyoka, Kanadeko, Nene, and Aria. Otoha is new member of the Verse Maidens, who is hard worker who is always positive, but is also still growing and can be prone to making clumsy mistakes. Kyoka has a strong sense of responsibility who does her job as a Verse Maiden while caring for others, and also has a hard time expressing feelings. Kanadeko has an explosive personality and often makes decisions without thinking clearly, Nene is very timid and often nervous and weak-willed, whom often shies away and hides behind Kanadeko, and Aria, whom is the eldest member of the Verse Maidens, whom is mysterious and tends to distance herself with her speech and behavior. Other characters include Takuto, protagonist of Omega Quintet, described as a positive guy whom acts as the Verse Maidens' manager and bodyguard, Momoka, a veteran Verse Maiden, Ayumi, Momoka's manager, Shiori, Kyoka's coach, Godou, the leader of the neighbourhood watch, and Tomekichi, a fan of the Verse Maidens, and is the leader of one of the supporting fan groups.\n\nThe game features \"costume destruction\" in a manner similar to Senran Kagura, which happens when the girls get parts of their clothing torn off as a result of taking repeated damage from enemies. Another feature in the game is the \"PVS (Promotion Video System)\", which allows players to make their own dance video and custom live performances to their liking. This is done choosing over 150 dances for the characters. Omega Quintet lets players make light waves and effects using the PlayStation Move controller, and they can feature in the music video itself by using the PlayStation 4 camera. During the game's fights, its Voltage Gauge fills up when Takuto protects the idols when the player attacks the enemies. When it rises to a certain point, the player can activate Live Mode, which gives the idols bonuses. The player must also adjust the turn order successfully, as team attacks are formed if characters act one after each other.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iibymxqj4kqhhdfsdygt.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "iibymxqj4kqhhdfsdygt", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lf2alabqw85x2kzl3yep.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "lf2alabqw85x2kzl3yep", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qd9jns28ycwqztcs2ugo.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "qd9jns28ycwqztcs2ugo", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n0igv8yw8kz7zqfb2fqr.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "n0igv8yw8kz7zqfb2fqr", "height": 540}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lxm6bhsrpp4b6boaf0pc.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "lxm6bhsrpp4b6boaf0pc", "height": 540}], "id": 9907}, {"name": "Moss", "videos": [{"video_id": "NgYJ2fBtMBM", "name": "E3 2017 Reveal Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/znmf3wdijaflgwm90vhk.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "znmf3wdijaflgwm90vhk", "height": 960}, "summary": "In\u00a0Moss, players can reach out, touch, and interact with the environment while guiding Quill through her journey.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series. \nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. \nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. \nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njd1ea2hjieo9xduirj3.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "njd1ea2hjieo9xduirj3", "height": 720}], "id": 1814}, {"genres": [5, 15, 32], "name": "X-Morph: Defense", "videos": [{"video_id": "wvoqAA7ZUVs", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x25zvtmwkbbnrhsl7s6h.jpg", "width": 510, "cloudinary_id": "x25zvtmwkbbnrhsl7s6h", "height": 217}, "summary": "Unique fusion of a top down shooter and tower defense strategy.
