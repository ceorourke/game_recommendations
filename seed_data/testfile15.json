The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the \"Witch Queen\". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin. \n \nFollowing the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book. \n \nCauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cvx3mdqgvbhutydwi491.jpg", "width": 769, "cloudinary_id": "cvx3mdqgvbhutydwi491", "height": 1209}, "id": 13469, "name": "Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back"}, {"genres": [5, 9], "summary": "Out in the vastness of space lies the heart of an Intergalactic Criminal Network, TALOS, a man-made asteroid slowly spinning through the void, spreading its evil through the Universe.

Local people tell of strange creatures that guard vast treasures hidden within the castle, though since no-one who has dared to venture inside has ever returned it's difficult to know how much is fact and how much speculation. \n \nNot too far away from the castle is a small cottage which you may as well use as your base.

With luck you may find there some items that will help you in your quest. \n \nThis program loads in three parts, but all you need to do is place the rewound cassette in your tape deck, then tap RUN/STOP while holding down one of the SHIFT keys. The screen will be blank whilst each section loads -- this is quite normal. \n \nAdventure programs offer you a chance to pit your wits against the ingenuity of the author. By instructing the computer to do things (move, examine objects, take objects etc) you must attempt to score as many points as possible. Points are usually scored for finding treasures and other objects, and sometimes for visiting particular places. Adventures can take months to solve, and so the best programs allow you to save the state of the game on cassette so that you can continue your quest another day. \n \nIf this is your first adventure you should try typing INFO which displays useful information. The computer will understand a wide range of words and phrases, but not absolutely everything that you throw at it. Some words are standard throughout most adventures -- NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, INVENTORY, DROP, TAKE, and SCORE are some of the most common, but you will usually have to experiment to find out just what the computer does understand. And beware, words that are understood in one location may not be understood in another. \n \nQuite complex sentences can be entered, for example, PUT THE RED APPLE IN THE BUCKET. First the program will check that the two objects mentioned are in the room (a room can be any location in the game), then it checks that you're actually holding the APPLE. Whether or not you are holding the BUCKET doesn't matter. It might be that there is more than one BUCKET visible, in which case you should specify the METAL BUCKET, the LARGE BUCKET or whatever. Finally the program will make sure that there is room in the BUCKET for the RED APPLE. \n \nNot all items mentioned in the adventure are objects which can be manipulated. Often they will serve merely to embellish a room description or to give you a hint about the nature of the place that you are in; in this case you will probably be told I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. \n \nAll adventures have mazes. They may not always look like mazes, but if you keep coming back to what seems to be the same place then you are probably in a maze. When you get lost in a maze (as you most certainly will) don't wander about aimlessly, but try to map the maze. TO do this you must be able to distinguish one part of the maze from another -- which usually means dropping some of the objects you are carrying. Of course, you might not ever find them again! \n \nYou can SAVE the state of the game at any time (it's a good idea to do it before doing anything particularly risky). Make sure that you have a blank cassette handy.

The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag.

There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit.

It is a horizontally scrolling game taking place over eight levels, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours (red, blue, and green) to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, can navigate between the levels through portals. At first the wizard only has access to the first three levels, but completing levels gains access to further levels. Each level has bouncing spheres of a different colours, and shooting them releases droplets, which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the correct colours. On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, further adding to the challenge. \n \nThe wizard himself is not capable of collecting paint droplets, and is initially capable of very limited movement, bouncing up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after next touching the ground. Collecting green pearls (which appear when some sprites have been shot) gives the player tokens which can be used to \"buy\" enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower, and also a companion known as Catellite. Catellite (ostensibly the wizard's cat) is also spherical in form. It normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which also renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets; the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player. As well as droplets of colours, sometimes droplets of other colours also appear, having various effects. These include: \n \nLight blue - causes a \"filth raid\", where a wave of fast-moving enemies appear, shooting bullets at the player. \nGrey - changes Catellite into an \"Indestructacat\", making it invulnerable to enemies. \nWhite - gives an extra life. \nPurple - changes Catellite into a \"mutant cat\", causing it to disobey the player's controls. \nBlack - causes \"freaky bits\", turning most of the scenery black.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ashbpze3j72ihbovl9ms.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "ashbpze3j72ihbovl9ms", "height": 256}], "id": 12234}, {"genres": [5, 33], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zjf4bep4j6uetkxi4izo.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "zjf4bep4j6uetkxi4izo", "height": 803}, "id": 13476, "name": "Challenge of the Gobots"}, {"genres": [5, 8, 33], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ywvj4wjleqjzwkc1wdub.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "ywvj4wjleqjzwkc1wdub", "height": 1226}, "id": 46658, "name": "Game Over II"}, {"genres": [33], "summary": "You are about to embark on one of the most dangerous missions of your career.
