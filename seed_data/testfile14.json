Special attention was given to its operation. The connection works deferred: it means that once an address is dialed and validated, the chevrons of the arrival gate are activated in order before the Gate opens. \n \nOn most planets you will find a DHD to compose an address. But in the SGC you can access dozens of programs, viewable in full-screen mode, that allow to view and controll precisely the activation process softwares! \n \nOnce the event horizon entered, the player finds himself in a sequence of desintegration, followed by a trip along a beautiful vortex. \n \nIn this game, you can play a character created by you and evolve in the Stargate universe depending on your choices. It is an open world game in which you can explore freely, or carry out missions if you are on active service to your faction. \nYour character will be defined by different characteristics : \n \n- Embodied race, it can grant you various physical, mental or technological bonuses. \n- The faction you belong to, that will influence your type of gameplay. \n- The class corresponding to your area of expertise. \n- A grade that can vary depending on your faction, and define your access and hierarchy within your homebase. \n- A team to carry out missions in cooperative mode. \n \nDepending on your race and your strengh, you will evolve differently from the others: the technologies are different, and weaponry too. Indeed, weapons will also be useful! You're not alone to travel the galaxy, and not everyone is lovely and friendly... \n \nAttention to detail and gameplay possibilities have been increased for the most important places of the franchise. Therefor the SGC is at the heart of our focus. \n \nThe Stargate Center is faithfully recreated, with the use of official blueprints of the series we have access to, as well as many pictures taken by fans in studios. Most of the objects, like computing equipment and enclosures have been identified on Internet to play the best. Hardcore fans of Stargate will be amazed by the amount of detail to the last bolt! \n \nIf you are lucky enough to find a Zero Point Module, you can unlock the 8th chevron and discover the amazing lost city of the Ancients, dormant beneath the ocean.

Tracking Grinko's license plate number using CCTV, Third Echelon tracks him to the Georgian Ministry of Defense. \n \nFisher arrives at the Ministry, and records a meeting between Grinko and Canadian hacker Phillip Masse, through which he learns that Nikoladze is conducting an illegal operation in Azerbaijan. Fisher hacks Nikoladze's computer, and learns Nikoladze has been waging an ethnic cleansing campaign across Azerbaijan, by deploying Georgian commandos. In retaliation, NATO forces enter Azerbaijan, prompting Nikoladze to go underground. \n \nThird Echelon learns that Georgian soldiers stationed on a Caspian oil rig have been exchanging data with the Georgian Presidential Palace. Fisher infiltrates the rig during the middle of a NATO airstrike to apprehend a local technician, Lejava, and retrieve his laptop containing the rig's computer data. After interrogating the technician, Fisher learns that the data contains a file on \"The Ark\", Fisher recovers his laptop and encryption key and extracts. \n \nExamining Lejava's laptop, Grim reveals that the intel could have come from a CIA mole. Lambert then reveals that North America has just been hit by a massive cyber warfare attack, directed primarily against military targets. In a broadcast, Nikoladze claims responsibility for the attack and officially declares war on the United States and its allies. Fisher infiltrates the CIA headquarters and accesses the CIA computer mainframe, allowing Grim to trace the data leak to the computer of Mitchell Dougherty. Captured for interrogation, Dougherty claims ignorance of the leak, but the NSA learns that his obsessive\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccompulsive disorder caused him to back up data on an insecure laptop, which was exploited by a network owned by Kalinatek, Inc. \n \nGeorgia-hired mafiosos attempt to remove all traces of Nikoladze from the Kalinatek offices by destroying the building and murdering the staff. Intercepting a 911 call from a technician named Ivan, Fisher is deployed to the building and retrieves Ivan's encryption key while the FBI rescues Ivan. Fisher extracts with the help of Wilkes, who is mortally wounded in the process and later dies. Using the encryption key, the NSA discovers Nikoladze has been using a network of unconventional relays to communicate with Georgian military cells. The NSA traces the full relay network to the Chinese Embassy in Yangon, Myanmar. Worried Chinese support could cause World War III, Fisher sneaks into the embassy and eavesdrops on a conversation between Nikoladze and General Kong Feirong, and learns they are working together. \n \nFisher learns that captured U.S. Army soldiers and high-ranking Chinese officials are in a local slaughterhouse, so he delays interrogating Feirong to save the hostages, who are scheduled to be executed on a live broadcast. Fisher meets with a Chinese official among the hostages, and learns that Feirong is part of a rogue collective not backed by the Chinese government. Fisher is detected, and in a firefight, Fisher kills Grinko. Returning to the embassy, Fisher grabs a drunken Feirong before he can commit suicide, and forces him to share the information stored on his computer; the information reveals Nikoladze has fled back to Georgia, where he is trying to activate a suitcase nuke known as \"The Ark\". \n \nInfiltrating the Georgian Presidential Palace containing Nikoladze and new de facto Georgian president Varlam Cristavi, Fisher attempts to recover the key to the Ark, which has been placed somewhere in the United States. Fisher corners Nikoladze, who bargains to give the Ark key in exchange for safe passage out of Georgia; before Fisher can recover it, Cristavi soldiers take Nikoladze and the Ark key elsewhere. About to be executed, Fisher escapes when Lambert causes a brief blackout. Discovering Nikoladze is offering the Ark's location for protection, Fisher assassinates Nikoladze. Discovering the Ark, the U.S. Army evacuates an apartment complex in Hope Gate, Maryland on claims of a gas leak, and secretly recovers the Ark. \n \nDespite World War III being averted, Nikoladze's corpse sparks international backlash due to the suspicious circumstances around his death. Watching the Presidential broadcast on the crisis, Fisher then receives a secure phone call from Lambert for another assignment. \n \n[from Wikipedia.org]", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zylmk1vqs5naozsmj2tq.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "zylmk1vqs5naozsmj2tq", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jlrcmjkzzfe4qzmizvc7.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "jlrcmjkzzfe4qzmizvc7", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xlbfh15qbodwa4rhopua.jpg", "width": 1024, "cloudinary_id": "xlbfh15qbodwa4rhopua", "height": 768}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/osk9fgnqbkmvpy3uzdki.jpg", "width": 1024, "cloudinary_id": "osk9fgnqbkmvpy3uzdki", "height": 819}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lyloewxlqoe8vlvk3qvl.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "lyloewxlqoe8vlvk3qvl", "height": 600}], "id": 910}, {"genres": [14], "summary": "Sega Superstars Tennis is a tennis video game developed by Sumo Digital, crossing over numerous Sega franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Alex Kidd, Space Channel 5 and 12 more.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wzlvp6f6rxyq7e7wf3ky.jpg", "width": 1530, "cloudinary_id": "wzlvp6f6rxyq7e7wf3ky", "height": 2148}, "id": 47367, "name": "Sega Superstars Tennis"}, {"genres": [10], "name": "Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing", "videos": [{"video_id": "i7KIeD1tNGo", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/shsjhpgfjqydrla8gc36.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "shsjhpgfjqydrla8gc36", "height": 268}, "summary": "SONIC AND SEGA ALL-STARS RACE FOR VICTORY IN A HIGH SPEED HIGH SKILL RACETRACK SHOWDOWN! \n \nTAKE TO THE TRACK BY CAR, MONSTER TRUCK, BIKE AND EVEN AEROPLANE IN SONIC & SEGA ALL-STARS RACING. \n \nExplore stunning new circuits including Sonic Seaside Hill, Curien Mansion and Blizzard Castle as you zip around medieval castle ramparts, hurtle under lush rain forest canopies and tear through bustling city scapes in a frantic race to the finish line.

Or are the mysteries hidden inside the cold walls of Black Mirror house of a far more wordly nature? \n \nIt is up to David to uncover the horrible truths, buried under generations of silence and fathoms of stone.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gnqjidorlhvup4zmnaam.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "gnqjidorlhvup4zmnaam", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ie08dsjewvj2rlnama0n.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "ie08dsjewvj2rlnama0n", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hqictbx0bchnpymzjcv2.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "hqictbx0bchnpymzjcv2", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vekqocfsias1p47gfp0u.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "vekqocfsias1p47gfp0u", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/irspbwefmopmthtdcm55.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "irspbwefmopmthtdcm55", "height": 1080}], "id": 54699}, {"genres": [8, 31, 32], "name": "INK", "videos": [{"video_id": "_sDMciRXDzM", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vdcvuizhoogaeoru158e.jpg", "width": 1499, "cloudinary_id": "vdcvuizhoogaeoru158e", "height": 500}, "summary": "INK is a fast-paced platformer about using colorful paint to uncover your surroundings. \n \nINK has a similar feel to hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy.

The double jump sprays paint bullets out of the player and increases the player's awareness of their surroundings.
