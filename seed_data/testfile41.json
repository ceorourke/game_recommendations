It was developed by Shigeru Miyamoto. \n \nMario Bros. features two plumbers, Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers of New York after strange creatures have been appearing down there. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. The mechanics of Mario Bros. involve only running and jumping. Unlike future Mario games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen (in the old version along with an object called a \"POW\" block in the center). Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right and vice versa. \nThe player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing its speed to maximum. There are three enemies in all: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; and the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform. Players may also make use of the above-mentioned \"POW\" block, which flips any enemy touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. This item can be used three times before it disappears. Coins appear whenever enemies are defeated and may be collected for bonus points. \nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and Slipices can freeze platforms, causing Mario and Luigi to skid. In addition, icicles start to form under the platforms and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the \"POW\" block regenerates itself on each of these screens.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k72rncu6357fmlevus3t.jpg", "width": 222, "cloudinary_id": "k72rncu6357fmlevus3t", "height": 312}, "id": 3105, "name": "Mario Bros."}, {"genres": [15, 32], "name": "Space Hulk", "videos": [{"video_id": "2Eeoxz2cQ4U", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pz1p71ds28stcxe9n0om.jpg", "width": 460, "cloudinary_id": "pz1p71ds28stcxe9n0om", "height": 215}, "summary": "Based on the best-selling board game and set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Space Hulk is a 3D digital turn based strategy game that recreates the classic claustrophobic board game experience for single player and multiplayer cross-platform play between PC, Mac and on iOS. \n \nSpace Hulk is set in the isolated corridors and tomb-like chambers of an ancient vessel lost in the graveyard of space.

Eventually, a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus. However, a globular yellow organism (an X) emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samus's body. \nFeeling no initial effects, Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment. On the way back to the laboratory, however, Samus loses consciousness, and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt. The ship's emergency systems automatically ejected Samus' escape pod, saving her from the crash, but her gunship is completely destroyed. Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew, who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X. \n \nSamus Infected 2 \nSamus, infected by the X Parasites. \nThe organic components of Samus's Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious. Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed, dramatically altering its appearance. However, the X in Samus's central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely; Samus's chances of survival were lower than one percent. \nMetroids are the only known predator of the X; however, since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission, the X were able to multiply unchecked. Seeing this as the key to curing her, doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus' dead Baby Metroid to make an anti-X vaccine. Apparently, the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time. The serum was prepared and injected without delay, completely eradicating the X. There were, however, two side effects: Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition, but she also inherited the Metroids' vulnerability to cold. \n \nUpon recovering, Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station, where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held. Once she arrives at the station, Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay, where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite. Samus speaks with her new gunship's computer (whom she has named \"Adam\", as it reminds her of a former CO) and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X. The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy, meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected. \n \nSA-X 1 \nThe SA-X. \nAs she continues to explore the station, Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself, dubbed the SA-X (or Samus Aran-X). Since the SA-X arose from Samus's fully-upgraded Power Suit, it has all of her powered-up abilities, as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay. By exploding the bomb, the SA-X also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens, releasing them all into the station. Well into her investigation of the station, Samus stumbles upon the facility's Restricted Lab. Here, she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity, all in stasis; these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware. Shortly after Samus discovers them, the SA-X attempts to destroy its predators, but its plan backfires: the Metroids break free and the emergency fail-safes are activated as a result. Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station, exploding over SR388. \nAfter the incident at the Restricted Lab, Samus speaks with her ship's computer, who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids. The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program, for \"peaceful applications\". The computer reveals that the station's SRX environment, a replica of the SR388 ecosystem, was ideal for raising Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and even Omega Metroids. The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth, allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days. Unfortunately, the SA-X had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the lab's location. Much to Samus's surprise, the computer also mentions that the SA-X has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station. \n \nLater, the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation. Apparently, the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SA-X and believe that this life-form has endless applications. Samus, having seen the SA-X's destructive capabilities firsthand, is strongly against this. She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land, absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process. If this happens, they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and \"galactic civilization will end.\" \n \nAs an alternative, Samus decides to activate the station's self-destruct mechanism in order to destroy the X, risking her own life in the process. However, her ship's computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room, as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival. Desperate, Samus yells at the computer: \"Don't let them do this. Can't you see what will happen, Adam?\" Puzzled at the use of the name, the computer inquires as to who this Adam was. Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life. Apparently moved by Samus's revelation, the computer agrees with the plan, and suggests that if Samus were to alter the station's orbit, then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion, thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station. At this point, Samus realizes that her ship's computer truly is Adam Malkovich, whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death. \n \nSamus hurries to the Operations Room, where she is confronted by an SA-X. She manages to defeat it, but its Core-X escapes before she can absorb it. Ignoring its escape, Samus initiates the self-destruct sequence and hurries back to her ship. However, she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone. Before she can react to the situation, an Omega Metroid appears, apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time. Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid, and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit. As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off, the SA-X returns, and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam, injuring it. However, it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid. This time, the Core-X hovers over Samus, allowing her to absorb it and obtain the \"Unnamed Suit\" as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its pre-vaccine state. Using her regained abilities, Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle. After the battle, Samus's ship reenters the bay, having been piloted by the computer, Adam, and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck. \n \nAs Samus leaves the station, it is shown crashing into SR388, destroying both the station and the planet, ridding the universe of the X forever. \n \nReflecting on her actions, Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X, nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted. Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation, but Adam comforts her, telling her: \"Do not worry. One of them will understand. One of them must.\" A final reflection, Samus goes on to say: \"we are all bound by our experiences. They are the limits of our consciousness. But in the end, the human soul will ever reach for the truth... This is what Adam taught me.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n4kzxxkbqfcgmvqrrr1k.jpg", "width": 565, "cloudinary_id": "n4kzxxkbqfcgmvqrrr1k", "height": 326}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dgkmzfeejab4cjv5of1x.jpg", "width": 563, "cloudinary_id": "dgkmzfeejab4cjv5of1x", "height": 325}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pklh1dwtua45w1abvysl.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "pklh1dwtua45w1abvysl", "height": 320}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmguzfi3u4weaydieah5.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "hmguzfi3u4weaydieah5", "height": 320}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/thwjhsmy6qucf6dksej5.jpg", "width": 471, "cloudinary_id": "thwjhsmy6qucf6dksej5", "height": 308}], "id": 1104}, {"genres": [15, 16, 24], "name": "Advance Wars", "videos": [{"video_id": "cmrncNt9xUA", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xj1vitetmgeefrb8kzrg.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "xj1vitetmgeefrb8kzrg", "height": 640}, "summary": "Just because this battle fits in the palm of your hand doesn't mean the stakes are small.

Dr. Edward Richtofen is heard via a television, carrying out his scheme on the Moon. Richtofen seizes control of the zombies by entering the Aether, but Dr. Ludvig Maxis works with his daughter Samantha and Richtofen's former allies, Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masakai to thwart him. To this end, Maxis launches three massive nuclear missiles filled with Element 115, the element responsible for the reanimation of dead cells, at the Earth, destroying it. One missile completely destroys Nuketown and all present.  \nYears later, Earth has been reduced to a crumbling, hellish wasteland overrun by zombies. In this new world, four survivors - Samuel J. Stuhlinger, Abigail \"Misty\" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, and Russman - have banded together to survive in Washington with the help of a bus driven by a robotic driver. The four are contacted by Maxis, now an digitally-rendered A.I., who is seeking humanity's aid against Richtofen. Maxis implores them to power up a tower in a cornfield using an electricity-based zombie. However, Richtofen contacts Samuel, who is able to hear voices from the Aether, and commands him to convince his friends to power up the tower in his favor. The player may choose to follow either Maxis or Richtofen's orders. It is revealed in audio transmissions that survivors from all over the world have been contacted by both Maxis and Richtofen, though there is widespread conflict between the followers of both Germans; particularly in a settlement known as Jackass Flats, which was initially a safe haven, only to fall to the zombies when the Maxis-Richtofen conflict consumed it.  \nRegardless of who they choose to aid, the four are teleported to a crumbling skyline in Shanghai, China. Here, Richtofen commands Samuel to \"mend the rift\" and accept his fate as a follower of Richtofen, threatening to expose his past as a member of a cannibalistic cult known as The Flesh, who eat zombie flesh to survive. Richtofen continuously revives the group whenever they fall to the zombies until they follow his orders. Maxis, who is no longer hampered by electric devices, contacts the group again for aid. The four learn through televisions scattered across the area of the Flesh, as well as the beginnings of a new airborne plague of Element 115, the element that reanimates dead cells and causes zombies.  \nFollowing their battles in Shanghai, Russman leads the group across the continents to a large hole in the ground known as \"the Rift\" in Africa, hoping to find answers about the unseen forces commanding them. Maxis and Richtofen contact them once again, more desperate than ever to achieve their goals. Both of them ask the group to power up the third and final tower in their favor. Maxis promises to heal the Earth, and Richtofen promises to save them from Maxis. The four gain a new ally in the form of a mute, unnamed giant in a western town built underground, and are hampered by a ghostly woman in a massive mansion. Depending on who the player has aided in the story, there are two possible endings. If the player has aided Richtofen, he will gain unlimited power over the Aether and the Earth, kill Maxis and condemn Samantha Maxis' soul to eternal damnation. He will then enter the body of Samuel as a reward for his aid, but finds he cannot exit it, and is at the mercy of the zombies as he was before. If the player has aided Maxis, he uses the power from the towers to enter the Aether and assume ultimate control, trapping Richtofen in a zombie's body. However, the Earth begins shaking, and Maxis explains to the four that he is beginning the process of the destruction of the Earth and humanity to reach Agartha, where he believes Samantha is.  \nUnbeknownst to all, Samantha is indeed in Agartha (which her father ultimately fails to enter) but reaches out to her father in 1918 France during World War I. Maxis is a leader of Group 935, who operate to secure Germany's victory in the war. To this end, they have created towering mechanical robots, suits of armor, and staffs that control the powers of the elements. Group 935 also stumbles upon an ancient tomb believed to be of Vrill origin, but this unleashes the first known zombie outbreak in history. Aiming to stop Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America send Takeo, Nikolai and Dempsey to capture Richtofen, the mastermind behind the advanced technology. By this time, Group 935's operatives have been wiped out, and Maxis himself was lobotomized when he began to turn into a zombie. The group put aside their nationalities to fight the undead, and are contacted by Samantha, begging to be freed from Agartha. Richtofen puts Maxis' brain in a flying drone, and he joins the fight against the zombies and to free Samantha. The group is eventually successful, and while Maxis meets his daughter, they enter Agartha to be rewarded. A cutscene is played of Samantha with a boy named Eddie, playing with toys of the characters who have appeared in the Zombies game mode throughout all three games. Air raid sirens are heard and the two children retreat to the basement with Maxis, with Samantha noting her father has a plan to make their games real.

Zero: Black-Haired Shrine Maiden) in Japan and Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water in PAL regions, is a survival horror video game developed by Koei Tecmo and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The fifth main entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa. \n \nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.", "id": 51149, "name": "Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water"}, {"genres": [31], "summary": "HELP DUSTY AND HIS FEARLESS FIGHTERS BATTLE MASSIVE FIRES AND LEARN WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME A TRUE HERO! \n \nBattle fires and save lives in over 30 Fire & Rescue Missions! \n \nProtect Piston Peak Park with 8 playable characters including Dusty, Lil\u2019 Dipper and Blade!", "id": 51186, "name": "duplicate - Planes Fire & Rescue"}, {"genres": [13], "name": "Star Fox Zero and Star Fox Guard - First Print Edition", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vbefo8vael7ndzpri8bs.jpg", "width": 973, "cloudinary_id": "vbefo8vael7ndzpri8bs", "height": 1500}, "summary": "Fox McCloud returns with Falco, Peppy and Slippy to save the Lylat system in this action-packed deep space dogfighting adventure.
