Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008. \n \nStreet Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a \"double KO\" or \"draw game\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match. \n \nAfter every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a \"bonus game\" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo. \n \nLike in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands. \n \nStreet Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves.

Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans.

Each character has a unique special shot that will temporarily disable anyone that comes in contact with the ball. This aspect of Mega Man Soccer was met with critical praise, but overall reception has been average, particularly due to its perceived poor play control.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ztkcuw8hz0vgdxogxc4i.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "ztkcuw8hz0vgdxogxc4i", "height": 311}], "id": 1730}, {"genres": [12, 31], "name": "Dragon Warrior III", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yumn6upxsn2bmqiznayy.jpg", "width": 636, "cloudinary_id": "yumn6upxsn2bmqiznayy", "height": 901}, "summary": "Dragon Warrior III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II. The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series. \nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. \nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. \nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njd1ea2hjieo9xduirj3.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "njd1ea2hjieo9xduirj3", "height": 720}], "id": 1814}, {"genres": [9], "name": "Tetris 2", "videos": [{"video_id": "S2XTPBZ4Q0Q", "name": "Teaser"}, {"video_id": "rZf4onJtyR4", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jzfuwyalganoepmzufkc.jpg", "width": 1533, "cloudinary_id": "jzfuwyalganoepmzufkc", "height": 2073}, "summary": "The mesmerizing fun of Tetris returns - and the challenge escalates to new heights!

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area. \n \nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend. \n \nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow. \n \nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u8w6yjbx6xbqiyjubdo5.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "u8w6yjbx6xbqiyjubdo5", "height": 224}], "id": 15843}, {"genres": [12], "name": "Treasure Hunter G", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/isg3sifkj3vb2oscwao6.jpg", "width": 250, "cloudinary_id": "isg3sifkj3vb2oscwao6", "height": 136}, "summary": "Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting.

The story-line is a parody of the Chinese novel Journey to the West, where two main characters, Goku and Chao, embark upon separate journeys to find one another. \n \nIn Yuuyuki, the \"Change Character\" command can switch between a maximum of five different characters. However, there are very few points in the game where it can actually be used to such extent. Its main use is to switch between Goku and the others accompanying him.

It is possible to enjoy the game by viewing the reactions towards choosing completely unrelated characters or commands in certain situations. \n \nWhile Shin Onigashima demanded rather complex puzzle-solving abilities, Yuuyuki mainly focuses on having the player carefully read and understand the story-line.

It is the first in a series of four Nazoler games. \n \nNazoler Land Soukan Gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off. \n \nNazoler Land Soukan Gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are: \n \nRotation Maze \nA maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze. \n \nNazoler Fortune-Telling \nDespite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star). \n \nSuper Jigsaw \nIn this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge. \n \nSave Princess Momoko! \nPromoted as the \"major feature\", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error. \n \nJapan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz \nA quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it. \n \nFamicom Reaction Test \nIn this simple \"game\", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel. \n \nExtrusion Puzzle \nSimilar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once. \n \n3D Maze \nA simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance.

It was developed and published by SunSoft for the Famicom Disk System. \n \nNazoler Land Dai 3 Gou is the third game in the Nazoler Land series. Like its predecessors, it was developed and published by Sunsoft for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System in Japan only, and contains various minigames with diverse gameplay. \n \nThese minigames include: \n \nSugoro Quiz \nAll three Nazoler games had a quiz minigame of some kind, but Sugoro Quiz is the first to emphasize a multiplayer aspect. Two to four human players compete in a board game in which players progress by answering trivia questions. \n \nTomo Bakuso \nThe second minigame starring the schoolgirl Tomo, after Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Blast Tomo. In this game, she is trying to pass through a level of platforms, some of which will block access after being passed through a certain number of times. \n \nTanteidan Boy Nazoler \nAn early example of an \"escape the room\" adventure game, which would become very popular in browser flash games and games like 999. The player must use the items in the room they are trapped in by clicking on items strewn around it and discover the exit. As the player interacts with the room it visibly changes. \n \nBingo \nNot so much a game but a Bingo simulator. Two to four players can generate a unique bingo card and the game will randomly select numbers. The first player to finish their card wins the game. \n \nNazoler BOX \nAs with Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Nazoler BOX, this isn't so much a minigame as a response to letters sent to SunSoft about the Nazoler Land series. Tomo, from Tomo Bakuso, answers user mail. Kirk, the protagonist of SunSoft's Dead Zone, makes a cameo appearance. \n \nNazoler BOX Contest Results \nIn Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Nazoler BOX there was a way to create pixel art which users could then print out and enter into a contest. This minigame simply comments on the various entries that SunSoft received. It is hosted by cameo characters from Dead Zone and Ripple Island.", "id": 41399, "name": "Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou"}, {"genres": [9], "summary": "The second game in the Nazoler Land series of minigame compilations published by SunSoft for the Famicom Disk System. \n \nNazoler Land Dai 2 Gou is the sequel to Nazoler Land Soukan Gou and is similarly a minigame connection with a magazine theme. It contains six minigames, rather than its predecessor's eight. A notable feature of this compilation is that all the minigames are represented as Famicom disks on the select screen, and once a game is chosen an animation shows the disk being loaded in the Famicom Disk System. \n \nThe minigames include: \n \nPatalick \nA panel-switching puzzle game that shares some similarities with Q*Bert (specifically, switching panel colors and the isometric perspective) but is far more cerebral and less active in nature. The goal is to use the shape-shifting protagonist (who transforms from an angel to a devil form) to switch all the panels on the screen to the same color, keeping in mind that every panel in a horizontal and vertical line will flip over. \n \nGeographic Nazoler Quiz \nLike the transportation quiz from the first Nazoler Land, this is a quiz game with a geographical theme. Rather than crossing over Japan in various types of transport, the goal is to travel the world and answer questions on different countries. Answering enough questions correctly allows the player to buy a ticket to the next location and progress forward. \n \nStraw Pistil \nA gambling game in which the player barters against AI opponents for money. The opponents are unpredictable, so the game is largely based on luck. \n \nBlast Tomo \nAs with \"Save Princess Momoko\" from Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or the Cheetahmen from Action 52), Blast Tomo is the \"major feature\" of the compilation. The goal is to help a schoolgirl, Tomo, reach the bottom of a stage with the strategic placing of a finite number of bombs to destroy blocks in the way. The player must also not any let mice touch Tomo on the way down. \n \nNazoler Boys' Detective Club \nA parody of Famicom Tantei Club, the player is the leader of a detective club currently investigating a mansion supposedly hiding incriminating evidence. Should the player make too many wrong decisions while exploring, the rest of the group will stop listening to them. \n \nNazoler BOX \nNot so much a game as a more overtly magazine section where an animated character (Tomo, from Blast Tomo) reads mail from players of the previous game as well as discuss promotional features of the Nazoler Land series.
