The game starts with the white star able to take 5 hits before it is destroyed. To make it grow, the player must collide his/her star with a similar-sized, blue star. Stars smaller than the player's star are gray-colored. Colliding with these stars will not change the white star's size, but if the player positions the white star just right, the gray star will orbit the white and become a satellite. Red stars are bigger than the white. The white star is able to orbit red stars to help travel through space. Whenever the white star grows large enough, the target star glows orange, and is able to be a satellite; as soon as that happens, a small crescent star appears, and having it successfully orbit the white star will give the player bonus points, (and collecting all different crescent stars unlocks new galaxies and are the goal to complete the game 100%). Colliding with the orange star will take away a hit, but having it orbit the white star will clear the round. The player guides the star by pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote to utilize gravity and anti-gravity, respectively, and attract it towards or repel against (also respectively) the gravitational wells of celestial objects. Players must be careful not to crash their star into the red stars or floating objects like asteroids, or be sucked into black holes, which takes away a hit (and in the case of black holes, restart the entire stage).", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fgnrisj6xkgdvaihimxg.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "fgnrisj6xkgdvaihimxg", "height": 360}], "id": 21181}, {"summary": "Rattle to rack up points in crazy mini-games!

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online. \n \nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero. \n \nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cx1reeizvzztoz44auop.jpg", "width": 639, "cloudinary_id": "cx1reeizvzztoz44auop", "height": 359}], "id": 2672}, {"genres": [7], "name": "Guitar Hero: Aerosmith", "videos": [{"video_id": "dE4A-1dpqYs", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mo7jjhqrsibdiaa97h0v.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "mo7jjhqrsibdiaa97h0v", "height": 320}, "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iqdhwwxsblytf8iml4di.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "iqdhwwxsblytf8iml4di", "height": 270}], "id": 2673}, {"genres": [7], "name": "Guitar Hero World Tour", "videos": [{"video_id": "wsWdDhIofMk", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "u7W_zAZ4VYQ", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gbngdhdwarlyxqmlhqcp.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "gbngdhdwarlyxqmlhqcp", "height": 320}, "summary": "Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept.

Nintendo currently has the most popular console out there, but the company has also been dominating the handheld world for two decades, so it only seems natural that the two systems would converge into one superpower system, similar to how Voltron, the Power Rangers, or Constructicons form into something more amazing than the sum of their parts. Pretty much every piece of cool tech out there does it, so it's high time Nintendo does too. Right? \nUnfortunately, there hasn't been too hot of a track record, as GameCube's connectivity started and ended with Zelda and the original Crystal Chronicles, and now Wii's offering is less than stellar. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time is a great DS game on its own, but it's entirely a cop-out Wii package, and one that not only drops the ball on its own, but is also far from an ideal multiplayer offering from handheld to console. Looking for a great DS dungeon crawler? You've found it. Want to skip on the handheld and grab it on Wii? You'd be better off waiting for the real Crystal Chronicles later down the line. \nIt isn't often I get to review DS and Wii games in tandem, but this is certainly a case where it's vital to do so, and the DS version destroys Nintendo's home console offering. Quite simply, Echoes of Time is 100% a DS port. After an oddly long load process, the Wii version of Crystal Chronicles runs a fully emulated version of the DS game, including everything from legal screens to the system's dual screen setup. The only difference for Wii cosmetically is that the + and \u2013 keys on the Wii-mote will resize the two screens on the fly.
