You may wish it didn't as I drew the tiles and am not an artist. \n \nI created POWDER for one simple reason: I wanted a roguelike on my GBA. The standard RPGs were annoying me with endless battle screens against weak enemies to unfold a drug induced plotline. I wanted a game I could just jump into and start killing things. Having had more hours than I'd care to log playing Nethack, ADOM, and the Diablos, I knew the exact type of game I wanted. The problem was I didn't see anyone publishing it any time soon. \n \nThis release of POWDER is for anyone in a similar situation who doesn't want to spend the time needed to write a roguelike.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/axxmokwf5kohnqqb1uyc.jpg", "width": 900, "cloudinary_id": "axxmokwf5kohnqqb1uyc", "height": 900}, "id": 49505, "name": "POWDER"}, {"genres": [8], "summary": "The Cat in the Hat is an Action game, developed by NewKidCo and published by Jack of All Games, which was released in 2005.", "id": 49507, "name": "The Cat in the Hat By Dr Seuss"}, {"id": 49463, "name": "Disney's The Jungle Book 2"}, {"genres": [31], "summary": "Word Safari combines the best of adventure video gaming with true learning content.

It was never released outside of Japan. \n \nShin Bokura no Taiyou: Gyakushuu no Sabata (aka \"Boktai 3\") is the third in a line of action-RPG's conceived by Hideo Kojima, for the GBA. Despite never being released outside of Japan, Boktai 3 has garnered a cult following in English-speaking countries, so much so that a fan-translation was released to the internet. It maintains the tradition of utilizing an in-cart solar sensor in gameplay. \n \nAn undetermined amount of time after the events of Boktai 2, main character Django finds himself sealed in an underground prison by Sabata. Sabata, falling to the Dark Matter that corrupts his body, has once again sided with the Immortals, a vampiric race, and wishes to release the Beast of Destruction, Vanargand, with the intent of becoming the Beast itself. Django recovers and then sets out on a quest to stop Sabata and the Immortals once again, whether that means killing Sabata or not. \n \nBoktai 3, like its two predecessors, is an action-RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players will control Django to traverse an array of different dungeons. Like the first game, Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand, Django will wield the Gun Del Sol (lit: Gun of the Sun) and swords (a feature introduced in Boktai 2 ), in addition to using light stealth elements such as pressing against walls and distracting enemies with noise to sneak by.  \n \nBeing an action-RPG, players can pick up loot, equip various pieces of armor, find weapons, and increase stats. Django has three different stats to upgrade: Vitality (increases Django's Hit Points), Spirit (increases Django's energy capacity when using the Gun Del Sol), and Strength (increases Django's overall attack power with all weapon-types). Armor can be equipped to the head, body, legs, in addition to an accessory. Each piece grants various stat bonuses and/or special effects, while different weapons have different attack powers, special effects, and attack styles.   \n \nUnlike Boktai 2, the Gun Del Sol is, once again, customizable with different lenses (change elemental properties), and different frames (change attack style). However, unlike Boktai 2, spears and hammers are no longer availible as melee weapons; the swords, though, now feature a wide array of effects and attack methods.  \n \nAs in past entries, the Boktai 3 cartridge holds a solar sensor. With it, players can use actual sunlight to affect the game. When Django is outside in the sunlight--or by some source of sunlight while inside--players can refill the Gun Del Sol's energy meter, dry up small water bodies, hasten or slow wind speed, speed up or delay timed hazards, or create \"solar bridges\". How much sunlight is hitting the solar sensor is represented by a 10-segment bar at the bottom of the screen.  \n \nIn dungeons, Django will sneak around, combat enemies, and solve puzzles. Occasionally, the player will find themselves in a \"Trap!\" room or a Mission, where the player will be put against a mini boss(es), or asked to fulfill certain objectives to proceed, respectively. At the end of each dungeon waits a boss, usually one of the Immortals. Django will be put into a life-or-death struggle in entertaining, diverse fights. When the battle is over, the boss is sealed in a coffin, and Django must then drag the coffin back through the dungeon, to the entrance (usually following a second, otherwise inaccessible, route through). Once there, Django will set up the \"Pile Driver\", a device used to destroy the Dark Matter that makes up an Immortal--the only way to actually destroy them--in another fight. Here, is one of the times where sunlight hitting the sensor is mandatory . The boss' life will drain only if sunlight gauge has at least one full segment. \n \nNew to the series, is the complete lack of explorable land outside dungeons. Past games had a full overworld and/or a central hub-town to run around in, and sometimes mini-dungeons other than the main Immortal dungeons. This game does not. The main town is a series of menus and small \"playable\" rooms. In between trips between the town and dungeons, are bike segments, new to the franchise, and unique to this game. Players will ride a bike, completely customizable, in a course-like stretch of land, fighting off enemy bikes and avoiding obstacles.", "id": 49778, "name": "Shin Bokura no Taiyou: Gyakushuu no Sabata"}, {"genres": [15], "summary": "Another title in the SD Gundam G Generation franchise.

Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen. \n \nKlonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack). \n \nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature. \n \n The Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech. \nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map. \n \nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature. These stages are underwater. \n \nNew Age Shutsudou marks the return of the first person Impact scenes, which were previously in some of the Super Famicom Goemon games. These scenes put the player in control of a large mech, fighting other robots.

In August 2004, former U.S. Navy SEAL officer and Gulf War veteran Sam Fisher is recruited by the National Security Agency to work within its newly formed division, \"Third Echelon.\" Working with his old friend Irving Lambert, Fisher is introduced to technical expert Anna \"Grim\" Grimsd\u00f3tt\u00edr, and field runner Vernon Wilkes Jr. \n \nIn October 2004, Fisher is dispatched to Tbilisi, Georgia to investigate the disappearance of two CIA officers. Fisher attempts to meet an informant, Thomas Gurgenidze, only to find him dying in a burning building. Gurgenidze warns that one agent's transmission mentioned proof that could cause a war. Finding the agents' corpses in a police morgue, Fisher learns that a former Spetsnaz agent, Vyacheslav Grinko, removed their subdermal tracking implants. Tracking Grinko's license plate number using CCTV, Third Echelon tracks him to the Georgian Ministry of Defense. \n \nFisher arrives at the Ministry, and records a meeting between Grinko and Canadian hacker Phillip Masse, through which he learns that Nikoladze is conducting an illegal operation in Azerbaijan. Fisher hacks Nikoladze's computer, and learns Nikoladze has been waging an ethnic cleansing campaign across Azerbaijan, by deploying Georgian commandos. In retaliation, NATO forces enter Azerbaijan, prompting Nikoladze to go underground. \n \nThird Echelon learns that Georgian soldiers stationed on a Caspian oil rig have been exchanging data with the Georgian Presidential Palace. Fisher infiltrates the rig during the middle of a NATO airstrike to apprehend a local technician, Lejava, and retrieve his laptop containing the rig's computer data. After interrogating the technician, Fisher learns that the data contains a file on \"The Ark\", Fisher recovers his laptop and encryption key and extracts. \n \nExamining Lejava's laptop, Grim reveals that the intel could have come from a CIA mole. Lambert then reveals that North America has just been hit by a massive cyber warfare attack, directed primarily against military targets. In a broadcast, Nikoladze claims responsibility for the attack and officially declares war on the United States and its allies. Fisher infiltrates the CIA headquarters and accesses the CIA computer mainframe, allowing Grim to trace the data leak to the computer of Mitchell Dougherty. Captured for interrogation, Dougherty claims ignorance of the leak, but the NSA learns that his obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder caused him to back up data on an insecure laptop, which was exploited by a network owned by Kalinatek, Inc. \n \nGeorgia-hired mafiosos attempt to remove all traces of Nikoladze from the Kalinatek offices by destroying the building and murdering the staff. Intercepting a 911 call from a technician named Ivan, Fisher is deployed to the building and retrieves Ivan's encryption key while the FBI rescues Ivan. Fisher extracts with the help of Wilkes, who is mortally wounded in the process and later dies. Using the encryption key, the NSA discovers Nikoladze has been using a network of unconventional relays to communicate with Georgian military cells. The NSA traces the full relay network to the Chinese Embassy in Yangon, Myanmar. Worried Chinese support could cause World War III, Fisher sneaks into the embassy and eavesdrops on a conversation between Nikoladze and General Kong Feirong, and learns they are working together. \n \nFisher learns that captured U.S. Army soldiers and high-ranking Chinese officials are in a local slaughterhouse, so he delays interrogating Feirong to save the hostages, who are scheduled to be executed on a live broadcast. Fisher meets with a Chinese official among the hostages, and learns that Feirong is part of a rogue collective not backed by the Chinese government. Fisher is detected, and in a firefight, Fisher kills Grinko. Returning to the embassy, Fisher grabs a drunken Feirong before he can commit suicide, and forces him to share the information stored on his computer; the information reveals Nikoladze has fled back to Georgia, where he is trying to activate a suitcase nuke known as \"The Ark\". \n \nInfiltrating the Georgian Presidential Palace containing Nikoladze and new de facto Georgian president Varlam Cristavi, Fisher attempts to recover the key to the Ark, which has been placed somewhere in the United States. Fisher corners Nikoladze, who bargains to give the Ark key in exchange for safe passage out of Georgia; before Fisher can recover it, Cristavi soldiers take Nikoladze and the Ark key elsewhere.
