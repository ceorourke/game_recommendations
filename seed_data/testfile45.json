Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team's members. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. \n \nDepending on which character the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry are separated from the rest of the team during the chase and do not make it to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character may encounter several members of Bravo Team, including Enrico Marini, the captain of the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments were being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus. \n \nEventually, the player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. In the lab, the player encounters Wesker, who reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier, to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction, at which point the player may be confronted by Tyrant one last time. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at key points over the course of the game. In the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter as the mansion self-destructs.

Tomba and Zippo wind up in a fisherman village where they meet an old man named Kainen. From there they move on to the Coal-Mining Town where Tabby's house is, but discover that she is unavailable. Gran, a denizen of the Coal-Mining Town, mentions seeing Tabby travel to the Kujara Ranch by trolley, but the trolley she used to travel there returns empty. A panicking trolley worker reveals that the Evil Pigs kidnapped Tabby when she tried to protect a penchant that was given to her by Tomba as a gift. Gran explains that the Evil Pigs have cursed the entire continent, and gives Tomba a red Pig Bag that is capable of capturing the Flame Pig that has cast his spell on the mines.\n\nTomba ventures throughout the continent gathering the rest of the Pig Bags. He cures the Coal-Mining Town of its inferno by capturing the Evil Flame Pig, cures the Kujara Ranch of its perpetual snowfall by capturing the Evil Ice Pig, cures the Donglin Forest's gloominess by capturing the Evil Ghost Pig, lifts the Circus Town's curse (which has turned its citizens into pigs) by capturing the Evil Earth Pig and cures the Water Temple of its perpetual rainfall by capturing the Evil Water Pig. When all of these Evil Pigs have been captured, their leader, the Last Evil Pig, reveals himself to Tomba and tempts him to find his lair. Tomba and Zippo locate the Last Evil Pig in an underground area underneath the Coal-Mining Town, where the Last Evil Pig freezes time in a last-ditch effort to stop Tomba. A final battle against the Last Evil Pig ends with his capture, but he promises his eventual return.

They intend to engage players emotionally by allowing them to build relationships with the game's characters and shape the outcome of the story through an array of conversation choices.[8] The game eschews certain conventions of action-oriented computer role-playing games such as the focus on a young lone hero's story, looting and buying items, or reloading a saved game state after defeat. Instead, the developers intended to tell the story of the player's caravan as a whole, and encourage players to accept and deal with the consequences of any defeats they may encounter.[9] \n \nThe first game in the Saga centers on the return of the Dredge, a warlike race that despises humans led by the Bellower, a nigh invincible Dredge who leads them on a warpath on human and Varl. As a wandering army sent to fight against the Dredge and find a weakness for the Bellower, many difficult decisions are made by the caravan that would shape the fate of both man and Varl.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/acwbnpw1fn6dof2l8oug.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "acwbnpw1fn6dof2l8oug", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hd8zpvqeotiheacyw2pr.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "hd8zpvqeotiheacyw2pr", "height": 450}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rmixp8swutdaaicoas0u.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "rmixp8swutdaaicoas0u", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxdqnhjaaii3ykutp4rk.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "sxdqnhjaaii3ykutp4rk", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pqajp7x3bahz0dwbze6q.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "pqajp7x3bahz0dwbze6q", "height": 1080}], "id": 5508}, {"genres": [12], "name": "Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cyopmicsqcsv1dib95ro.jpg", "width": 1524, "cloudinary_id": "cyopmicsqcsv1dib95ro", "height": 1903}, "summary": "Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment is a Japanese role-playing game based on the Sword Art Online light novel franchise and a \"Director's Cut\" version of Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment.

The player controls the protagonist Tim as he runs, jumps, and climbs across the game's levels. Tim jumps and stomps on enemies to defeat them, and can collect keys to unlock doors or operate levers to trigger platforms. A defining game element is the player's unlimited ability to reverse time and \"rewind\" actions, even after dying. The game is divided into six worlds, which are experienced sequentially and can be entered from different rooms of Tim's house; the player can return to any world previously visited to attempt to solve puzzles they missed.", "storyline": "Tim is a man searching for a princess who \"has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster.\"His relationship with this princess is vague at best, and the only clear part of this relationship is that Tim has made some sort of mistake which he hopes to reconcile or, if possible, erase. As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid, storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim's quest for the princess, and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration. The final level, in which everything but Tim moves in reverse, depicts the princess escaping from a knight, and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home. Tim is suddenly locked out of the house, and, as time progresses forward, reversing Tim's actions, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight. Tim is revealed to be the \"monster\" the princess is running from. \nFollowing completion of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb\u2014\"Now we are all sons of bitches\"\u2014is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development.[20] Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braid's plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as \"You must look back to go forwards\" as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he \"would not be capable\" of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is \"something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly.\"Blow considered Braid to be \"about the journey, not the destination\". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide \"a longer-term challenge\".", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hlgubb2qmioujlw2alq6.jpg", "width": 940, "cloudinary_id": "hlgubb2qmioujlw2alq6", "height": 529}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xyzfrllx4iqggitmmil1.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "xyzfrllx4iqggitmmil1", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gm2hmeizg03ohzgjlqhp.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "gm2hmeizg03ohzgjlqhp", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lvr4kfokntgawqvkfsqi.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "lvr4kfokntgawqvkfsqi", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oqxrufwqwvaqjohlhomw.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "oqxrufwqwvaqjohlhomw", "height": 720}], "id": 2853}, {"genres": [4, 31], "name": "Bully", "videos": [{"video_id": "88KNf0MtU14", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ulzyp2wnsz1vm2ich4ly.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "ulzyp2wnsz1vm2ich4ly", "height": 331}, "summary": "As a mischievous schoolboy, you\u2019ll stand up to bullies, get picked on by teachers, play pranks, win or lose the girl, and ultimately learn to navigate the obstacles of the worst school around, Bullworth Academy - a corrupt and crumbling prep school with an uptight facade.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lyptnezmeap9ta9a4djb.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "lyptnezmeap9ta9a4djb", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xmuftiijqutyaxs7k7bz.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "xmuftiijqutyaxs7k7bz", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/drd6gji7lldmifn3eww3.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "drd6gji7lldmifn3eww3", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/brm0ig6djd68sjt7lghb.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "brm0ig6djd68sjt7lghb", "height": 1080}], "id": 2720}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x6e5ig72xycwhus1kket.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "x6e5ig72xycwhus1kket", "height": 720}, "summary": "KickBeat \u2013 Special Edition offers up a full-length single-player campaign, beautifully hand-drawn animations and a strikingly unique art style.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hxkqmz0hoze3qhrhfnrj.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "hxkqmz0hoze3qhrhfnrj", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhwole2bjdczvibn2cvl.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "fhwole2bjdczvibn2cvl", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g2gqxqnmngj6rkzl5ic3.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "g2gqxqnmngj6rkzl5ic3", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g6wvtrxuahau0xyfgvpl.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "g6wvtrxuahau0xyfgvpl", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wwh8wmzckc0gqrjrygvt.jpg", "width": 618, "cloudinary_id": "wwh8wmzckc0gqrjrygvt", "height": 350}], "id": 20059, "name": "KickBeat: Special Edition"}, {"genres": [31], "name": "Goosebumps: The Game", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pg4dovsds52xnf2guskx.jpg", "width": 1024, "cloudinary_id": "pg4dovsds52xnf2guskx", "height": 1024}, "summary": "The walk home from school today is going to be a lot spookier than usual\u2026 Your sleepy neighborhood\u2019s been overrun by monsters!

This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more. \n \nYou must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you. \n \nHowever, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self. \n \nThere are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going. \n \nThe bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that\u2019s not all, as some enemies can\u2019t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out. \n \nEnemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes. The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils. \n \nAs this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness. \n \nFloating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve. \n \nThe final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better. \n \nSeems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in. \n \nThat's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity. \n \nThis description was compiled from the following reviews: \n \nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review \n \nhttp://www.pspminis.com/8859/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here/", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/me2fthoxcasdo6urhbpr.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "me2fthoxcasdo6urhbpr", "height": 722}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ce3lcgipt6jnofvfrtxa.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "ce3lcgipt6jnofvfrtxa", "height": 722}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wpsxnzkhjdpzmvnt1jla.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "wpsxnzkhjdpzmvnt1jla", "height": 722}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/foyvxdoonwuimrxd5xzc.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "foyvxdoonwuimrxd5xzc", "height": 722}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wcumlly0vzsle69ybtic.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "wcumlly0vzsle69ybtic", "height": 722}], "id": 22321}, {"genres": [4, 25], "name": "Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versus", "videos": [{"video_id": "Di0aqg-6vy8", "name": "Game intro"}, {"video_id": "X718WIRjFD4", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xc551g5akprojqfds11s.jpg", "width": 600, "cloudinary_id": "xc551g5akprojqfds11s", "height": 765}, "summary": "Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is the third video game in the Senran Kagura series, and is the sequel to Senran Kagura Burst.

The game stars Shadow the Hedgehog and his quest to recover his memory, a goal he has been pursuing since his debut in Sonic Adventure 2, while an evil alien race known as the Black Arms is invading the planet.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kxa4vqnhyymzz89kkxpl.jpg", "width": 305, "cloudinary_id": "kxa4vqnhyymzz89kkxpl", "height": 218}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rpqvciqpuoxoy37shvl0.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "rpqvciqpuoxoy37shvl0", "height": 360}], "id": 4105}, {"genres": [14], "name": "MLB 13: The Show", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vnbqlocm4znataql9wrw.jpg", "width": 200, "cloudinary_id": "vnbqlocm4znataql9wrw", "height": 233}, "summary": "MLB 13 The Show allows you to experience the MLB like never before.

Set, the god of chaos, once ruled all of Egypt after murdering his brother Osiris and enslaving the other gods, but when Egypt was no longer enough, he vanished into the land of the dead intent on raising an army that could conquer the world, but he never returned. \n \nLara Croft, famed explorer, thought she would be first to arrive at the temple, but up-and-coming archeologist Carter Bell beat her to the entrance. They each hoped to find the mythical Staff of Osiris, but they discovered more than they bargained for. \n \nThe Temple was a prison for Horus and Isis, the last of the old gods not bound to Set. Seeing the Staff, Carter removed it from a mechanism, setting off the trap meant to keep Horus and Isis imprisoned. Lara and Carter now find themselves marked for death. Horus and Isis, freed from thousands of years in prison and in possession of the staff, promise Carter and Lara they will help them resurrect Osiris, the only god capable of saving Lara and Carter from judgment, and the only power that can hope to defeat Set. With a common goal of finding the fragments of Osiris, and stopping the return of Set, the companions form an alliance. \n \nAs they fight their way across the sands, they must face gods and monsters of myth and legend driven mad and controlled by Set. At stake is the fate of the world, as Set marshals his powers in order to return and reclaim his throne in the world of the living, with an army of the dead behind him.
