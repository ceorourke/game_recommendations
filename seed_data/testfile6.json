Snowblind Studios is in the unique position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights to world of Middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and never-before-seen locations. The result is a journey that is both epic and intimate, familiar yet unexpected. \n \nACTION MEETS RPG \nIntense, visceral, and satisfying combat. Rich, layered, and impactful character progression. In War in the North, you get both. Find and equip the best loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with friends by your side. Fight through the brutal realities of the war on all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. Immerse yourself and make your own mark on Middle-earth. \n \n \nCO-OP AT ITS CORE \nBuild your own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the North. The survival of your group and all of Middle-earth depends upon your uniquely skilled heroes working together. You must fight together or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. The first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean. \n \n \nAN UNTOLD STORY \n While much attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the One Ring, the assault on Middle-earth hits all corners of the map.

As a result, faith in the Hakurei Shrine's deity began to fall like the leaves from the trees. It's in such a season that Reimu Hakurei, the shrine maiden of the Hakurei shrine, is visited by a mysterious stranger who claims to represent a god of mountains and orders her to shut the shrine's doors for good. Reimu is deeply troubled by this state of affairs, as she knows the shrine can't be allowed to close down due to the role it plays in watching over the Great Hakurei Border. Marisa Kirisame, her ordinary magician friend, is suspicious and also suitably bored. \n \nPROLOGUE \nDepending on who you choose, one of these girls finally decides to ascend the Youkai Mountain to confront the mysterious deity behind the threats. \n \nMAIN SCENARIO \nEn route to the mountain, the heroine encounters several of Gensokyo's myriad gods, including two spirits of autumn, Shizuha Aki and Minoriko Aki, and a curse god, Hina Kagiyama, who tries to chase her away from the dangers of the mountain (unsuccessfully). As our heroine reaches the foot of the mountain and begins to climb it, another youkai appears to try to convince her to leave - Nitori Kawashiro, the valley kappa. After Nitori's equally unsuccessful bid to get her to go away, she mentions that a god has recently appeared on the mountain, causing some trouble for the tengu and kappa that live there. \n \nAscending the waterfall that fed the rivers Nitori swam in, the heroine faces the forces that guard the mountain from outside influence, including Momiji Inubashiri and the traditional tengu reporter, Aya Shameimaru, who was sent to investigate by the leaders of the tengu society due to her familiarity with outsiders. Aya puts up a token fight, but eventually allows the human interloper to pass on to the lake where a new shrine, the Moriya Shrine, has appeared. As she enters the grounds, she is confronted by a new shrine maiden - Sanae Kochiya. Sanae says that the lake and the Moriya Shrine were both recently moved to Gensokyo, and that she intends to collect all of Gensokyo's faith for \"Lady Yasaka\". Naturally, to do that would mean the end of the Hakurei Shrine, to which our heroine objects, leading to a battle where Sanae is ultimately defeated. At the top of the mountain, our heroine finds a lake surrounded by pillars, and Kanako Yasaka. Kanako, a goddess of the wind and rain, seeks to gain all of Gensokyo's faith in order to prevent the declining level of faith in Gensokyo to reach the point where its gods lose their power. Were such a thing to happen, she believes, Gensokyo would fall into a state of chaos. After a protracted battle, however, Kanako is convinced to make peace with the tengu and kappa, who are also convinced to accept her as the goddess of the Youkai Mountain.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uphdqrjbft5ybu3bzm0o.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "uphdqrjbft5ybu3bzm0o", "height": 720}], "id": 27167}, {"genres": [10, 14], "name": "Colin McRae Rally", "videos": [{"video_id": "Ig5qQR6_9cw", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "t6-t4icDYsQ", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/alpvowvcicwxjsnjoudw.jpg", "width": 315, "cloudinary_id": "alpvowvcicwxjsnjoudw", "height": 315}, "summary": "Hit the dirt in Colin McRae Rally - the classic off-road racing experience.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m0usvlni6r0ic90zahtl.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "m0usvlni6r0ic90zahtl", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/klc3vrmt2tungy2pnuws.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "klc3vrmt2tungy2pnuws", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/py5ojqusv6rta3jcl7am.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "py5ojqusv6rta3jcl7am", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o1uwmcxnnh43uufsfchc.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "o1uwmcxnnh43uufsfchc", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jqk2eawoxyhliiuj2r14.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "jqk2eawoxyhliiuj2r14", "height": 626}], "id": 26821}, {"genres": [8, 31], "summary": "Sonic After the Sequel is an unofficial sequel in the blue hedgehog's franchise that takes place somewhere between Sonic 2 and Sonic 3.

Carey begins an investigation that leads him deep into the criminal life of the city and a hunt for a maniacal murderer. \n \nThe game utilizes Sierra's traditional icon-based interface for interaction with the environment and generally follows an adventure format. However, it focuses on realistic police procedures even more than the previous games in the series. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to examining crime scenes, questioning suspects, and conducting a by-the-book investigation. There is a considerable degree of freedom in the interaction, allowing the player to perform actions not connected to the main story, some of which will, however, lead to the protagonist's death. The game utilizes digitized photorealistic images for its visuals.", "id": 50482, "name": "Police Quest 4 - Open Season"}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cl6ozr8rwxqueqczvh2m.jpg", "width": 1062, "cloudinary_id": "cl6ozr8rwxqueqczvh2m", "height": 1500}, "id": 50879, "name": "Tomb Raider: The Final Hours Edition"}, {"genres": [12], "summary": "Gameplay is very similar to that of the action role-playing game Diablo II.

When Aion refused to grant them the power they desired, the power to rival his own, they revolted and declared war on the god that created them. Aion's hand was forced, and he created the twelve Empyrean Lords, beings of divinity and power to protect the Tower of Eternity. \n \nSome humans \"ascended\" to become Daeva and, like the Empyrean Lords, had wings and the ability to fight the Balaur.

The five Drakan Lords were invited inside the barrier for peace talks, but before the peace-talks could begin, one of the Drakan Lords was nearly assassinated by an unknown assailant. In the fighting that followed, the Tower of Eternity was destroyed, resulting in the cataclysm that broke Atreia in half. Five Empyrean Lords, most of whom opposed the peace treaty, came to power in the dark part of the world, \"Asmodae,\" and became known as the Shedim Lords.

After a philosopher discovered that whale oil\u00e2\u20ac\u201dknown in the city as trans\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcan be used as a fuel, the government used it to develop powerful weaponry, which in turn bred government corruption. The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats, which is killing the poor and isolating the rich. The infected, known as \"weepers\", cry blood and can become violent. The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge citizens as they wish. Order is maintained by the Tallboys, heavily armored officers on tall, mechanical legs, and districts are separated by barriers known as \"Walls of Light\", which are made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized people who try to cross them. A covert group of activists, the Loyalists, plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress' daughter as the new Empress. \n \n[from Wikipedia.org]", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r2ikbnyz6q1i1norkljg.jpg", "width": 7308, "cloudinary_id": "r2ikbnyz6q1i1norkljg", "height": 4568}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cknxefnbrlfw6ewtmjtn.jpg", "width": 7648, "cloudinary_id": "cknxefnbrlfw6ewtmjtn", "height": 4304}], "id": 20863}, {"genres": [12, 25], "name": "Dynasty Warriors 9", "videos": [{"video_id": "skA1jSjLiik", "name": "History.

In August 2004, former U.S. Navy SEAL officer and Gulf War veteran Sam Fisher is recruited by the National Security Agency to work within its newly formed division, \"Third Echelon.\" Working with his old friend Irving Lambert, Fisher is introduced to technical expert Anna \"Grim\" Grimsd\u00c3\u00b3tt\u00c3\u00adr, and field runner Vernon Wilkes Jr. \n \nIn October 2004, Fisher is dispatched to Tbilisi, Georgia to investigate the disappearance of two CIA officers. Fisher attempts to meet an informant, Thomas Gurgenidze, only to find him dying in a burning building. Gurgenidze warns that one agent's transmission mentioned proof that could cause a war. Finding the agents' corpses in a police morgue, Fisher learns that a former Spetsnaz agent, Vyacheslav Grinko, removed their subdermal tracking implants. Tracking Grinko's license plate number using CCTV, Third Echelon tracks him to the Georgian Ministry of Defense. \n \nFisher arrives at the Ministry, and records a meeting between Grinko and Canadian hacker Phillip Masse, through which he learns that Nikoladze is conducting an illegal operation in Azerbaijan. Fisher hacks Nikoladze's computer, and learns Nikoladze has been waging an ethnic cleansing campaign across Azerbaijan, by deploying Georgian commandos. In retaliation, NATO forces enter Azerbaijan, prompting Nikoladze to go underground. \n \nThird Echelon learns that Georgian soldiers stationed on a Caspian oil rig have been exchanging data with the Georgian Presidential Palace. Fisher infiltrates the rig during the middle of a NATO airstrike to apprehend a local technician, Lejava, and retrieve his laptop containing the rig's computer data. After interrogating the technician, Fisher learns that the data contains a file on \"The Ark\", Fisher recovers his laptop and encryption key and extracts. \n \nExamining Lejava's laptop, Grim reveals that the intel could have come from a CIA mole. Lambert then reveals that North America has just been hit by a massive cyber warfare attack, directed primarily against military targets. In a broadcast, Nikoladze claims responsibility for the attack and officially declares war on the United States and its allies. Fisher infiltrates the CIA headquarters and accesses the CIA computer mainframe, allowing Grim to trace the data leak to the computer of Mitchell Dougherty. Captured for interrogation, Dougherty claims ignorance of the leak, but the NSA learns that his obsessive\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccompulsive disorder caused him to back up data on an insecure laptop, which was exploited by a network owned by Kalinatek, Inc. \n \nGeorgia-hired mafiosos attempt to remove all traces of Nikoladze from the Kalinatek offices by destroying the building and murdering the staff. Intercepting a 911 call from a technician named Ivan, Fisher is deployed to the building and retrieves Ivan's encryption key while the FBI rescues Ivan. Fisher extracts with the help of Wilkes, who is mortally wounded in the process and later dies. Using the encryption key, the NSA discovers Nikoladze has been using a network of unconventional relays to communicate with Georgian military cells. The NSA traces the full relay network to the Chinese Embassy in Yangon, Myanmar. Worried Chinese support could cause World War III, Fisher sneaks into the embassy and eavesdrops on a conversation between Nikoladze and General Kong Feirong, and learns they are working together. \n \nFisher learns that captured U.S. Army soldiers and high-ranking Chinese officials are in a local slaughterhouse, so he delays interrogating Feirong to save the hostages, who are scheduled to be executed on a live broadcast. Fisher meets with a Chinese official among the hostages, and learns that Feirong is part of a rogue collective not backed by the Chinese government. Fisher is detected, and in a firefight, Fisher kills Grinko. Returning to the embassy, Fisher grabs a drunken Feirong before he can commit suicide, and forces him to share the information stored on his computer; the information reveals Nikoladze has fled back to Georgia, where he is trying to activate a suitcase nuke known as \"The Ark\". \n \nInfiltrating the Georgian Presidential Palace containing Nikoladze and new de facto Georgian president Varlam Cristavi, Fisher attempts to recover the key to the Ark, which has been placed somewhere in the United States. Fisher corners Nikoladze, who bargains to give the Ark key in exchange for safe passage out of Georgia; before Fisher can recover it, Cristavi soldiers take Nikoladze and the Ark key elsewhere. About to be executed, Fisher escapes when Lambert causes a brief blackout. Discovering Nikoladze is offering the Ark's location for protection, Fisher assassinates Nikoladze. Discovering the Ark, the U.S. Army evacuates an apartment complex in Hope Gate, Maryland on claims of a gas leak, and secretly recovers the Ark. \n \nDespite World War III being averted, Nikoladze's corpse sparks international backlash due to the suspicious circumstances around his death. Watching the Presidential broadcast on the crisis, Fisher then receives a secure phone call from Lambert for another assignment. \n \n[from Wikipedia.org]", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zylmk1vqs5naozsmj2tq.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "zylmk1vqs5naozsmj2tq", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jlrcmjkzzfe4qzmizvc7.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "jlrcmjkzzfe4qzmizvc7", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xlbfh15qbodwa4rhopua.jpg", "width": 1024, "cloudinary_id": "xlbfh15qbodwa4rhopua", "height": 768}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/osk9fgnqbkmvpy3uzdki.jpg", "width": 1024, "cloudinary_id": "osk9fgnqbkmvpy3uzdki", "height": 819}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lyloewxlqoe8vlvk3qvl.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "lyloewxlqoe8vlvk3qvl", "height": 600}], "id": 910}, {"screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/afpniqxnwemhoum7br3y.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "afpniqxnwemhoum7br3y", "height": 360}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fyicm3afyc0wzzsu1wbd.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "fyicm3afyc0wzzsu1wbd", "height": 400}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/adgn8glhyn94tqz2shoq.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "adgn8glhyn94tqz2shoq", "height": 360}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ipchscmskog2trgivxrs.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "ipchscmskog2trgivxrs", "height": 360}], "id": 28244, "name": "Nobunaga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ambition: Taishi"}, {"genres": [5, 12, 15, 32], "name": "Freeman: Star Edge", "videos": [{"video_id": "SbzyelSWgmQ", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "HH2GssnIAc4", "name": "Gameplay video"}, {"video_id": "hoGw6U42wVw", "name": "Gameplay video"}, {"video_id": "i7xFnkoPzOA", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "summary": "Exiled to the edge of a Galaxy full of danger and opportunity; will you become a mercenary, hunting down outlaws?

Magicians within an Order would study for most of their lifetime to master a single school of magic. After decades of combat on the battlefield and in the great courts, a clear power emerged; The Fictorum, born with the talent to master all offensive schools of magic. Threatened by their supremacy, the Orders banded together to overcome the Fictorum. Battered by overwhelming numbers, the Fictorum dwindled and were nearly defeated until...  \n  \n   The Great Cataclysm: an elite of the Fictorum order used his powers to envelop the planet in shadow; a simple mist with the capability to corrupt and destroy all it touches. Millions died as a result and, though his efforts were effective, humanity endured\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat the highest points of the world where the mist cannot reach.  \n  \n   The surviving group of Magical Orders, now calling themselves the Inquisition, worked together to hunt down the remaining Fictorum to prevent this incredible power from ever being used again. They built magical nexuses in the dormant ley-line network spreading across the planet, providing survivors transport between the mountaintops. Utilizing theses nexuses, humanity built settlements and eventually entire civilizations perched on the crown of the world. All the while, the Inquisition remained vigilant for traces of the Fictorum.  \n  \n   You and a handful of others are the last of the surviving line of Fictorum. Without the lust for destruction some of your predecessors possessed, you have spent all of your life studying with your Order on the deadly outskirts of the ley-line network, where the Inquisition dare not tread. Your studies have passed without much incident until recently; storms with surges of the mist have been occurring more and more frequently, bringing with it terrible, twisted creatures that challenge even your own considerable powers. As the frequency of these storms increased, you and the others of your order abandoned your home in search of safety and, after a time, were captured by the Inquisition. Though your Elders explained that they meant no harm and pleaded to be taken to the Grand Inquisitor to explain the new threats of the storms, they were executed by the army sent to dispatch you. Helpless, you were forced to watch as your friends, colleagues, and family were slaughtered before you. As the last Fictorum awaiting execution, those that found you thought it a fitting end to force you to walk into the corruption that the First had caused.  \n  \n   Stretching the limits of your power, you have survived, but your body has been warped with corruption. Though previously young, you have aged decades. Your mind flickers with the horrors you saw above and within the depths of the mist. The Inquisition is responsible for what happened to you and your Order, and, since they will not listen, they will burn for what they have done.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pj32oaqftui229b6bmsz.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "pj32oaqftui229b6bmsz", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dtkxyocwljxkq9yhlzuq.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "dtkxyocwljxkq9yhlzuq", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aykwe6xovxjbcdx8sshg.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "aykwe6xovxjbcdx8sshg", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z5qaekkm80xyyf33jpao.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "z5qaekkm80xyyf33jpao", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v4zs5ldq5bjqzywh9vd3.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "v4zs5ldq5bjqzywh9vd3", "height": 1080}], "id": 19604}, {"genres": [5], "name": "Dusk 12: Deadly Zone", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/knvo49qmghxqseimgisi.jpg", "width": 421, "cloudinary_id": "knvo49qmghxqseimgisi", "height": 596}, "summary": "The project to create the perfect soldier ran out of control, and turned itself into an incurable virus.

The most advanced and realistic model of command decision-making implemented to date in a commercial wargame, combined with thorough historical research on the battlefields and forces involved in this campaign sets Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge apart from the competition. \n \nSet during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge, Command Ops lets gamers assess, plan, order and react at the operational level just like a real Corps, Division and Brigade commander. Hundreds of hours of gameplay await armchair generals who will be challenged to fight their way across 27 scenarios that stretch from the initial German surprise offensive to the powerful Allied counter-attack. \n \nCommand Ops: Battles from the Bulge also sports some of the most advanced and impressive AI ever devised in an operational-level wargame! It is your choice whether to manage every detail of your army, or have the friendly AI manage the war on a lower level while you plan the larger scale maneuvers designed to make short work of your enemy. Just as a historical commander, you can choose where you need to step in and when you need to stand back and let your subordinates do their jobs. \n \nThe enemy AI will use its skill to launch well-timed and coordinated strikes as it probes your lines for weakness while realistically reacting to your movements!
