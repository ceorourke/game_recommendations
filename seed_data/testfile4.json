He learns that to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find four ancient magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world, hidden in secret and mysterious sanctuaries consisting of the four elements water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air.[10] He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies.[10] \n \nIn the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir. \n \nEventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes. Rayman is presumed dead and only one of his shoes is found, but during his funeral, he appears again, walking on a crutch.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p5f6jjdumqgwkdczoqgv.jpg", "width": 710, "cloudinary_id": "p5f6jjdumqgwkdczoqgv", "height": 443}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rchshoav4tqwwhq6wxei.jpg", "width": 710, "cloudinary_id": "rchshoav4tqwwhq6wxei", "height": 443}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ubysryri3h4ve9gtlqde.jpg", "width": 710, "cloudinary_id": "ubysryri3h4ve9gtlqde", "height": 443}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tfsd0jextrgamwam6uic.jpg", "width": 710, "cloudinary_id": "tfsd0jextrgamwam6uic", "height": 443}], "id": 843}, {"genres": [14], "name": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2", "videos": [{"video_id": "ADFhiXzBeRg", "name": "Game intro"}, {"video_id": "L7Q4lr4312o", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eksrjpbmz4kdlz6yxoqc.jpg", "width": 547, "cloudinary_id": "eksrjpbmz4kdlz6yxoqc", "height": 637}, "summary": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 redefined an already great game.

Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the \u201cPuyo Puyo Circus\u201d. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn't worried, she didn't even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn't find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back! \n \nThis version of the game have different music and lacks the voiced cutscenes due to cartridge's memory limitations, but can be played in 4-player mode like the Dreamcast version and included a Transfer Pack mode where one could unlock more artwork by plugging in Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nvvhej3ixqgkcgyeou2q.jpg", "width": 200, "cloudinary_id": "nvvhej3ixqgkcgyeou2q", "height": 199}, "id": 3579, "name": "Puyo Puyo~n Party"}, {"genres": [12], "summary": "Celtland has been cast into chaos by the theft of Eletale's Book.
