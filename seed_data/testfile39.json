It picks up where The Sands of Time left off, adding new features, specifically, options in combat. The Prince now has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from The Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular \"wave\" of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies as well as damaging them. The dark tone, a vastly increased level of blood and violence as well as sexualized female NPCs earned the game an M ESRB rating.", "storyline": "Set seven years after the events of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the Prince finds himself constantly hunted by a terrible beast known as the Dahaka. The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases The Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka's mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.    \nHe later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time's fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past. The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black, whose name is Shahdee. Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time, who is busy preparing to create the Sands, Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides. The Prince makes his way through the fortress, utilizing the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present, and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka, who he discovers cannot pass through water. The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress - the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower - that serve as locks to the door. He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself, who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate, just as the Prince is doing. A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious; he kills Kaileena and returns to the present. What lies ahead is the most dramatic Twist in the Prince's life, and He starts believing the priest who told him \"You cant change your Fate! No Man Can..\"  But Prince is not going to give up that easily.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fgu93hfwgaxplv0wxjof.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "fgu93hfwgaxplv0wxjof", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl0y51arwkuojwnacjuh.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "pl0y51arwkuojwnacjuh", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mjvy64ze3eamjlenvyrd.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "mjvy64ze3eamjlenvyrd", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/okrsxfeimtpcqjq2kcad.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "okrsxfeimtpcqjq2kcad", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wdte0mkqkcd1d3pmyv9x.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "wdte0mkqkcd1d3pmyv9x", "height": 600}], "id": 837}, {"genres": [12, 31], "name": "Atelier Online", "videos": [{"video_id": "aPm0PddGyuA", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uskilshlowg8dgmmwzov.jpg", "width": 639, "cloudinary_id": "uskilshlowg8dgmmwzov", "height": 900}, "summary": "A free-to-play multiplayer mobile game set in the Atelier universe, planned to be released this winter in Japan.

The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors. \n \nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an \u201cAdvance Time\u201d to speed up the flow of time.

At the end of each in-game day, the player earns money based on how many immigrants they processed less any penalties for mistakes, and then must decide on a simple budget to spend that money on rent, food, heat, and other necessities in low-class housing for themselves and their family. As relations between Arstotzka and nearby countries deteriorate due to multiple terrorist attacks, each day introduces a new set of rules for immigration based on the game's story, such as denying citizens of specific countries or demanding more exacting identification from citizens. The player may be challenged with moral dilemmas and social engineering as the game progresses; such as allowing the supposed spouse of one immigrant through despite them lacking complete papers, even though they may be planning to attack your fellow guards.   \nA mysterious anti-government organisation also appears, with several of its members appearing in the checkpoint, giving the inspector orders on what to do in order to help the organisation bring down the government and establish a new one; the player can choose whether or not to help this organisation.   \nThe game has a scripted story mode with multiple possible endings depending on the player's previous actions, as well as an unlockable, randomized endless-play mode.   \nPapers, Please has been praised by the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction.[12] CBC News' Jonathan Ore called Papers, Please a \"nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters - all from a desk job\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/babxzbm0ejcxfvnotowf.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "babxzbm0ejcxfvnotowf", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pqnoclnus8ut4jzkmrid.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "pqnoclnus8ut4jzkmrid", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lbia8ajpcyijwb1qx91u.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "lbia8ajpcyijwb1qx91u", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/brqlr1zleb7mj0fwadt2.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "brqlr1zleb7mj0fwadt2", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lb5flcvxmwr6twjqrmlk.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "lb5flcvxmwr6twjqrmlk", "height": 720}], "id": 2935}, {"genres": [10], "name": "Offroad Legends 2 - Hill Climb", "videos": [{"video_id": "viYQyuzNctE", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xtbuibbu9czf6u2pyyzf.jpg", "width": 300, "cloudinary_id": "xtbuibbu9czf6u2pyyzf", "height": 300}, "summary": "This is your chance to experience the thrill of driving Monster Trucks, desert Trucks and 4x4 off-roaders over amazing jump filled hill climbing tracks.  \nExperience cutting edge graphics, ground breaking physics, amazing cars and adrenaline-filled excitement in Offroad Legends 2!", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dgi9ea2ijzs8uni5vtcs.jpg", "width": 1334, "cloudinary_id": "dgi9ea2ijzs8uni5vtcs", "height": 750}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kduwosyf3qfvyqn2kwcu.jpg", "width": 1334, "cloudinary_id": "kduwosyf3qfvyqn2kwcu", "height": 750}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qfcgzdnhqsatqyr8cmqi.jpg", "width": 1334, "cloudinary_id": "qfcgzdnhqsatqyr8cmqi", "height": 750}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sgcjje9no78d1ngxlhe4.jpg", "width": 1334, "cloudinary_id": "sgcjje9no78d1ngxlhe4", "height": 750}], "id": 38028}, {"genres": [33], "name": "Zombie Tsunami", "videos": [{"video_id": "oYpU07T25Tk", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vkmrdmsaewl9rzocyzfc.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "vkmrdmsaewl9rzocyzfc", "height": 256}, "summary": "The zombies are revolting !

As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. \n \nInstead of leveling, heroes have \"resolve\" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero's resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. \n \nWhile exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well.
