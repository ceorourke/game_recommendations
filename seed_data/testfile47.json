Experience a new and enthralling chapter in the Metroid series, and relive the timeless gameplay and exploration that made the series a legend.", "storyline": "The game begins with Samus Aran acting as a bodyguard for the Biologic's research team on planet SR388. Eventually, a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus. However, a globular yellow organism (an X) emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samus's body. \nFeeling no initial effects, Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment. On the way back to the laboratory, however, Samus loses consciousness, and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt. The ship's emergency systems automatically ejected Samus' escape pod, saving her from the crash, but her gunship is completely destroyed. Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew, who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X. \n \nSamus Infected 2 \nSamus, infected by the X Parasites. \nThe organic components of Samus's Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious. Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed, dramatically altering its appearance. However, the X in Samus's central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely; Samus's chances of survival were lower than one percent. \nMetroids are the only known predator of the X; however, since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission, the X were able to multiply unchecked. Seeing this as the key to curing her, doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus' dead Baby Metroid to make an anti-X vaccine. Apparently, the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time. The serum was prepared and injected without delay, completely eradicating the X. There were, however, two side effects: Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition, but she also inherited the Metroids' vulnerability to cold. \n \nUpon recovering, Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station, where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held. Once she arrives at the station, Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay, where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite. Samus speaks with her new gunship's computer (whom she has named \"Adam\", as it reminds her of a former CO) and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X. The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy, meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected. \n \nSA-X 1 \nThe SA-X. \nAs she continues to explore the station, Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself, dubbed the SA-X (or Samus Aran-X). Since the SA-X arose from Samus's fully-upgraded Power Suit, it has all of her powered-up abilities, as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay. By exploding the bomb, the SA-X also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens, releasing them all into the station. Well into her investigation of the station, Samus stumbles upon the facility's Restricted Lab. Here, she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity, all in stasis; these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware. Shortly after Samus discovers them, the SA-X attempts to destroy its predators, but its plan backfires: the Metroids break free and the emergency fail-safes are activated as a result. Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station, exploding over SR388. \nAfter the incident at the Restricted Lab, Samus speaks with her ship's computer, who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids. The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program, for \"peaceful applications\". The computer reveals that the station's SRX environment, a replica of the SR388 ecosystem, was ideal for raising Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and even Omega Metroids. The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth, allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days. Unfortunately, the SA-X had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the lab's location. Much to Samus's surprise, the computer also mentions that the SA-X has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station. \n \nLater, the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation. Apparently, the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SA-X and believe that this life-form has endless applications. Samus, having seen the SA-X's destructive capabilities firsthand, is strongly against this. She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land, absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process. If this happens, they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and \"galactic civilization will end.\" \n \nAs an alternative, Samus decides to activate the station's self-destruct mechanism in order to destroy the X, risking her own life in the process. However, her ship's computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room, as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival. Desperate, Samus yells at the computer: \"Don't let them do this. Can't you see what will happen, Adam?\" Puzzled at the use of the name, the computer inquires as to who this Adam was. Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life. Apparently moved by Samus's revelation, the computer agrees with the plan, and suggests that if Samus were to alter the station's orbit, then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion, thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station. At this point, Samus realizes that her ship's computer truly is Adam Malkovich, whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death. \n \nSamus hurries to the Operations Room, where she is confronted by an SA-X. She manages to defeat it, but its Core-X escapes before she can absorb it. Ignoring its escape, Samus initiates the self-destruct sequence and hurries back to her ship. However, she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone. Before she can react to the situation, an Omega Metroid appears, apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time. Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid, and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit. As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off, the SA-X returns, and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam, injuring it. However, it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid. This time, the Core-X hovers over Samus, allowing her to absorb it and obtain the \"Unnamed Suit\" as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its pre-vaccine state. Using her regained abilities, Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle. After the battle, Samus's ship reenters the bay, having been piloted by the computer, Adam, and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck. \n \nAs Samus leaves the station, it is shown crashing into SR388, destroying both the station and the planet, ridding the universe of the X forever. \n \nReflecting on her actions, Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X, nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted. Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation, but Adam comforts her, telling her: \"Do not worry. One of them will understand. One of them must.\" A final reflection, Samus goes on to say: \"we are all bound by our experiences. They are the limits of our consciousness. But in the end, the human soul will ever reach for the truth... This is what Adam taught me.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n4kzxxkbqfcgmvqrrr1k.jpg", "width": 565, "cloudinary_id": "n4kzxxkbqfcgmvqrrr1k", "height": 326}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dgkmzfeejab4cjv5of1x.jpg", "width": 563, "cloudinary_id": "dgkmzfeejab4cjv5of1x", "height": 325}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pklh1dwtua45w1abvysl.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "pklh1dwtua45w1abvysl", "height": 320}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmguzfi3u4weaydieah5.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "hmguzfi3u4weaydieah5", "height": 320}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/thwjhsmy6qucf6dksej5.jpg", "width": 471, "cloudinary_id": "thwjhsmy6qucf6dksej5", "height": 308}], "id": 1104}, {"genres": [8, 31], "name": "Castlevania", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eqn7jrhk5y34avr3lwla.jpg", "width": 576, "cloudinary_id": "eqn7jrhk5y34avr3lwla", "height": 830}, "summary": "Step into the shadows of the deadliest dwelling on earth.

Little is known about this mysterious and dark planet. \n \nOne thousand years have passed since Alis and her friends liberated Algo from the evil Lassic. Algo has since prospered under the care of a giant computer called the Mother Brain. The Mother Brain regulates the climatrol tower, the bio-systems lab, and all other things that provide whatever the people in Mota need. \n \nThe game begins with the character Rolf recalling a strange recurring nightmare he has been having. In the dream, a young girl who Rolf does not recognize (but who resembles Alis) is battling a demon. Finally, just before the demon would kill her, Rolf awakens. From his home in Paseo, Mota's capital, Rolf goes to the central tower to meet with the commander, the head of government on Mota, in order to receive his newest mission. \n \nThe first threat is an increase in dangerous biomonsters (biologically altered animals). Rolf sets off with his companion Nei, a humanoid with cat-like features, to investigate, accompanied by six others with each different, but same purpose. Along the way, the group discovers a human-biomonster hybrid named Neifirst, who reveals that Nei's origins are the same as her own. Being part biomonster, she is an outcast from society, causing her to loathe mankind and, because of this, sabotage both Mota's climate control system and the biosystems laboratory. Nei confronts Neifirst and battles her in a one-on-one fight, but is defeated and killed. Anguished, Rolf and the remaining party defeat Neifirst, bringing an end to Mota's Biomonster hazard. \n \nHowever, this sets another incident in motion: the exploding impact causes the central lake, the residential reservoir of Mota, to overflow with water. To prevent a massive flood, Rolf and his friends decide to open up the surrounding four dams. After unlocking the last one, they are captured by Mother Brain's security robots and sentenced to death upon the Gaira satellite. However, the satellite malfunctions and collides with Palm, destroying both. Rolf and company are rescued in the nick of time by a space pirate, Tyler. \n \nThe group boards Mota's last plane to Dezo. Located at a far corner of the planet is the Esper Mansion. Upon reaching there, Rolf awakens the legendary Lutz from a long sleep. Lutz reveals the secrets of Rolf's past, as well as the dark secret of Mother Brain which relates to the fate and destruction Algo is now facing. In order to save the system, the heroes seek to recover the powerful Nei arsenal, found in four hidden dungeons, capable against the enemies on the spaceship Noah, where Mother Brain resides. \n \nIt is eventually revealed that Dark Force has been behind every threat Rolf has faced, including Mother Brain itself. Rolf confronts the two evil entities and defeats them. After the final battle, Lutz alerts him that there are still people on the ship: the remaining survivors from Earth. They reveal they created Mother Brain to satisfy their greedy lifestyle at the expense of Algo's resources, and a fight between the heroes and the earthmen ensues. The game ends there on an open-ended note, with the outcome of the fight left unrevealed.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uxlo3mokey3t5y7oxmcx.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "uxlo3mokey3t5y7oxmcx", "height": 960}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dobfcijlcgmhcj2txhyv.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "dobfcijlcgmhcj2txhyv", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tkvknapi8mxsvdncmwwz.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "tkvknapi8mxsvdncmwwz", "height": 463}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jjrofs5jheiayrkmhv0o.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "jjrofs5jheiayrkmhv0o", "height": 224}], "id": 1232}, {"genres": [12], "name": "Phantasy Star", "videos": [{"video_id": "gujjNjW2qVc", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cw92mubpti8as0u5p5ro.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "cw92mubpti8as0u5p5ro", "height": 1117}, "summary": "The time: Space Century 3240.

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. \n \nScattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. \n \nThe game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress. \n \nAt the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues). \n \nWhen Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a \"Secret Zone\" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nf1iu9lmtr4nzdz2a2mh.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "nf1iu9lmtr4nzdz2a2mh", "height": 270}], "id": 3192}, {"genres": [4], "name": "Eternal Champions", "videos": [{"video_id": "8VEsAIYJYnY", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qnleiyejpm8hsp30echi.jpg", "width": 256, "cloudinary_id": "qnleiyejpm8hsp30echi", "height": 358}, "summary": "Sega released Eternal Champions for their Mega Drive/Genesis in 1993, hoping to capitalize on the fighting game mania that the game industry was in the midst of following the massive success of Street Fighter II (1991) and Mortal Kombat (1992).

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games. \n \nThe player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated. \n \nEnemies turn \"angry\" \u2014 becoming pink-colored and moving faster \u2014 if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence). \n \nAfter a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost. \n \nContact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) results in death.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hwbgrtxakeodkfwzlppe.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "hwbgrtxakeodkfwzlppe", "height": 750}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/el9zsctos0tamlhg2aat.jpg", "width": 540, "cloudinary_id": "el9zsctos0tamlhg2aat", "height": 506}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nckph4earsembk75t6mi.jpg", "width": 540, "cloudinary_id": "nckph4earsembk75t6mi", "height": 506}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t7oo9mhc4yeodrutksgu.jpg", "width": 540, "cloudinary_id": "t7oo9mhc4yeodrutksgu", "height": 506}], "id": 2630}, {"genres": [4, 25, 33], "summary": "YOU CAN TEACH A NEW SKULL OLD TRICKS \n \nMetro City is under attack, and this time a new crime organization is claiming responsibility.

Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons. \n \nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low. \n \nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.", "storyline": "Vicious predators from the far ends of the universe are invading our planet!

A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima's involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection. \n \nThe game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world. \n \nThe player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the \"Alert Mode.\" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery: \n \nIf Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen. \nHowever, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator. \nThe player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters. \n \nThe enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank. \n \nA transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.", "storyline": "Near the end of the 20th century, the West discovers that a weapon of mass destruction is being constructed inside Outer Heaven, a fortified state founded by a \"legendary mercenary\" 200 km north of Galzburg, South Africa. The special forces unit FOXHOUND sends top agent Gray Fox to infiltrate the fortress, assess the situation and neutralize the threat. FOXHOUND loses contact with Gray Fox a few days later, with his last transmission being \"METAL GEAR...\" To discover what happened to Gray Fox, FOXHOUND commander Big Boss sends his newest recruit, Solid Snake, into the area in an operation codenamed Intrude N313. \n \nUpon insertion into Outer Heaven, Snake makes contact with local resistance members Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer. Using all of his skills and the equipment he procures on site, he manages to rescue Fox. Fox explains that Metal Gear is the codename of a nuclear-equipped bipedal walking tank, which can engage in all forms of combat and launch nuclear weapons from any location. Outer Heaven plans to use Metal Gear to impose itself as the new world superpower. \n \nTo destroy Metal Gear and topple the Outer Heaven mercenaries, Snake rescues lead Metal Gear engineer Dr. Pettrovich Madnar and his daughter Ellen. The scientist explains how Metal Gear can be destroyed, and Snake takes on Outer Heaven's troops. However, he begins to notice that traps put in his way are too precise, and wonders how information on his activities are being tracked. Big Boss begins to act strangely and eventually tells Snake to abort the mission (breaking the fourth wall by telling the player to turn off the console). Moreover, Schneider is ambushed by hostiles and is presumed dead after losing contact with Snake. \n \nSnake penetrates Outer Heaven's main base and takes out Metal Gear before it reaches completion. As he safely escapes the compound's basement, he is confronted by the mercenary leader of Outer Heaven, who turns out to be Big Boss. The corrupt leader reveals that he had been using his connections to steal military intelligence, establish his own mercenary force, and fund his activities. It was his aim to have Outer Heaven become the world's greatest superpower, able to bring even the West to its knees. He had the rookie Snake sent in, hoping to have him captured and feed misinformation to authorities, but had quite obviously underestimated Snake's capabilities. \n \nHaving lost Metal Gear and much of his force, Big Boss seemingly starts the self-destruct sequence for the compound, and promises he will not die alone; Snake will join him. Snake defeats Big Boss in a last battle and escapes the Outer Heaven compound as it crumbles in flames behind him. After the end credits, a message from Big Boss is displayed saying that he will meet Solid Snake again.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rgjawyebnq6aosddko5g.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "rgjawyebnq6aosddko5g", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rmfgz4zn5xh1jbbcce7x.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "rmfgz4zn5xh1jbbcce7x", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a6uyywwymuifmztmhyhy.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "a6uyywwymuifmztmhyhy", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qyhfu3limtt8bbivebtd.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "qyhfu3limtt8bbivebtd", "height": 720}], "id": 374}, {"genres": [12, 31], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Red", "videos": [{"video_id": "WP4R-wVeT9s", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbrf9nvqe8cd12h2c9sk.jpg", "width": 898, "cloudinary_id": "nbrf9nvqe8cd12h2c9sk", "height": 890}, "summary": "Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue Versions offer a JRPG experience in which you capture and \"evolve\" your team of monsters by training them to higher levels.
