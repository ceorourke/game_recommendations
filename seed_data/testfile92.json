The Queen of England has enlisted the character's help to solve the mystery behind the ghostly apparitions in and around Ravenhearst manor. The player character is provided the recently acquired diary belonging to Emma Ravenhearst which holds the key to unraveling the history of this unsettling place, yet some pages are missing. The player must venture into Ravenhearst, find the missing pages, and solve the mystery. \nAs the player collects the pages of the diary, the story reveals itself. Emma Ravenhearst, a young girl from Iowa, arrived in Blackpool, England on August 24, 1894 after having been graduated from a teacher's college. She is hired at a local school and boards with the schoolmistress, also helping with household tasks. \nAt a community autumn party on September 10, 1894, Emma meets a handsome, wealthy young man named Charles Dalimar. He is smitten by Emma. Several months later, on March 16, 1895 he proposes to Emma. \nAfter thinking about the fact that she has, as she says in her diary, just begun her life, she declines the proposal. Charles is hurt, but two weeks later on April 5, 1895 he visits Emma again, carrying roses. He tells her that he has purchased a tract of land and is building a manor. \nA workman, Frank Williams, falls while working on the house in May 1895.. He leaves behind a wife and two children. At the funeral, Charles mutters to Emma something about being forever alone at his \"bedevilled\" manor. \nOn May 23, Emma gets a letter from her sister back in America telling her that their father is seriously ill. She makes plans to leave, but then falls ill. As she worsens, Charles moves her into the manor and cares for her. \nHe hires a woman named Rose Somerset to take care of Emma. Emma, despite her condition, continues to write in her diary and she and Rose become friends. (Note: source for edits to this point come directly from the diary in the Ravenhearst game.) \nUnfortunately, Emma's health keeps on failing. She starts having nightmares where she is wearing a white bridal dress. She has not heard anything from her family. Charles behaviour has become suspicious & he has taken to reading the books of black magic & necromancy. Rose is finding the situation creepy. When Rose discovers a dress similar to the one Emma wore in her nightmare, the duo believe that Charles is trying to harm them. This also happens to be the second last entry in Emma's diary. \nThe last entry to the diary is dated \"Today\", and is written by the ghost of Emma, who haunts the manor. It urges the player to find seven skeleton keys hidden throughout the manor, and visit the cellar to open the cellar door with them. When the player accomplishes this, an upright casket is found, which, when opened, reveals the remains of Emma, dressed in the wedding gown. It is heavily implied that Charles has murdered Emma in fear of abandonment. The skeleton dissolves as Emma's spirit is freed from the manor.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pqqecegk0zuvkig21ugi.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "pqqecegk0zuvkig21ugi", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l7gm4z99barpnxzzdq8i.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "l7gm4z99barpnxzzdq8i", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xvkzsrza8syqpnkthqtj.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "xvkzsrza8syqpnkthqtj", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nbmqk4iuwzpcayw8q94h.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "nbmqk4iuwzpcayw8q94h", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xrpmgm83u29juqfpkziu.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "xrpmgm83u29juqfpkziu", "height": 480}], "id": 5511}, {"genres": [15, 16, 24], "name": "Fantasy Wars", "videos": [{"video_id": "Lywq29JKOGc", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oxovnljfh1rsyomtmhms.jpg", "width": 420, "cloudinary_id": "oxovnljfh1rsyomtmhms", "height": 600}, "summary": "Fantasy Wars is a classic turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world.

During the missions, you will be exploring the given scenario; you\u2019ll be interacting with people in the past, as well as occasionally using stealth to avoid situations, all to achieve your objectives. We figure it will run around 2-4 hours of game play, in addition to three extra \u2018present\u2019 missions which draw you further into the It\u2019s TIME story, as you feel and experience your work in the past, reflected. \n\nThe \u201cIt\u2019s TIME\u201d Team \nWe\u2019re a bunch of passionate geeks; coders, designers, artists, musicians and overly talkative voice actors.

The Predator is the most durable of the three player characters and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. The player can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to detect enemies, including an infrared vision mode and a mode sensitive to electrical systems.\n\nAs an Alien the player can explore most of the game's environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. The Alien has no weapons, however, using its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The screen is distorted into a fish eye lens effect to reflect the Alien's field of view.

The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters.\n\nSeveral bonus levels allow each player character access to portions of the missions of the other characters.

As an Alien the player must defend the Alien hive from human marines, then stow away on an evacuating spacecraft and reach the marines' ship, the Ferarco. When the Ferarco's self-destruct system is activated, the player must reach the escape shuttle, which takes them to Gateway Station. Here the player explores the station and battles more marines, reaching a ship departing for Earth. Before boarding the ship the player battles two Predators, after which the Alien enters the Earth-bound shuttle.\n\nWhen playing as the Colonial Marine, the player begins at a research station on LV-426 built to study the derelict spacecraft where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs in the film Alien (1979). Aliens attack and the player must fight their way through the research facility, the derelict ship, and an adjoining colony. Next the player explores the atmosphere processing station and shuts down its cooling valves in order to cause an explosion which will wipe out the Aliens. The player character escapes in a drop ship and travels to Odobenus Station in orbit above the planetoid, where they battle more Aliens, Predators, facehuggers, and cybernetically-enhanced Aliens until reaching the spaceship Tyrargo. Aboard the ship the player battles more enemies including an Alien/Predator hybrid and \"praetorian\" Aliens. The player then battles an Alien queen, defeating it by expelling it through the airlock.\n\nThe Predator character's storyline visits three different planets, beginning with the player hunting marines in order to recover a captured Predator ship and its occupant from a human military base. Aliens are accidentally released in the base and the player discovers that the humans have created an Alien/Predator hybrid by implanting the captured Predator with an Alien embryo. The player defeats the hybrid, triggers the facility's self-destruct mechanism, and escapes in the Predator ship. The player next visits Fiorina \"Fury\" 161, the prison planet that is the setting of Alien 3 (1992), where more Aliens and marines are battled.

Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via \"skyways\" that propel him through the air. \n \nDuring his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (\"Mancers\") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well. \n \nTo repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion. \n \nAfter the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcccbp6huxz4ea2mn5md.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "bcccbp6huxz4ea2mn5md", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dutrfep6budmbhqjva27.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "dutrfep6budmbhqjva27", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/peydgf7t6il73ad6actd.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "peydgf7t6il73ad6actd", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqv2ubfkqsji4kz9oyxa.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "dqv2ubfkqsji4kz9oyxa", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xsl6film2bhrgdtimpkn.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "xsl6film2bhrgdtimpkn", "height": 1080}], "id": 1983}, {"genres": [31, 32], "name": "Sally Face", "videos": [{"video_id": "c5zIp12TO0Y", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fg1mwoy4mw78ojmrp7si.jpg", "width": 1350, "cloudinary_id": "fg1mwoy4mw78ojmrp7si", "height": 500}, "summary": "In this story-driven adventure game, players will interact with Sal's world and his nightmares.

The current age is called the \"Ninth World\" by its scholars, who believe that eight great ages existed and were destroyed or disappeared for unknown reasons before their time, leaving ruins and various oddities and artifacts behind. These artifacts are known as the \"numenera\" and represent what is left of the science and technology of these past civilizations. Many of them are irreparably broken, but some are still able to function in ways that are beyond the level of understanding of most humans, who believe these objects to be magical in nature.      \n      \nThe protagonist of the story, known as the Last Castoff, is the final vessel for the consciousness of an ancient man, who managed to find a way to leave his physical body and be reborn in a new one, thus achieving a kind of immortality by means of the relics. Unknown to him, however, every time he abandoned \u2013 or \"cast off\" \u2013 these host bodies, they awoke with a consciousness of their own, having no memory of their former master or his deeds. The actions of this man, known as the Changing God to some, attracted the enmity of the \"Angel of Entropy\", who now seeks to destroy him and his creations. The Last Castoff, being one such \"creation\", is also targeted by the Angel, and must find their master before both are undone. To do so, the protagonist must explore the Ninth World, discovering other castoffs, making friends and enemies along the way. One means of such exploration are the \"Meres\" \u2013 artifacts that let their user gain control over the lives of other castoffs, and experience different worlds or dimensions through them. Through these travels the Last Castoff will leave their mark on the world \u2013 their Legacy \u2013 and will find an answer to the fundamental question of the story: What does one life matter?", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kpo2lsmkbeygxn1be4mk.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "kpo2lsmkbeygxn1be4mk", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u9jmrvjaos597i4xbhrl.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "u9jmrvjaos597i4xbhrl", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fjxctcsqvdys6wn2t1lp.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "fjxctcsqvdys6wn2t1lp", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hrnllreoo19unopqdoyy.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "hrnllreoo19unopqdoyy", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dzwagdesvnw4er5ztmcw.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "dzwagdesvnw4er5ztmcw", "height": 1080}], "id": 2004}, {"genres": [12, 31, 32], "name": "Runt of the Litter", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmkx1ewsisaogwwuzfof.jpg", "width": 408, "cloudinary_id": "bmkx1ewsisaogwwuzfof", "height": 272}, "summary": "Steal and raise a baby war gryphon!

Electronic Arts\u2019 award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series\u2019 history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod\u2019s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI\u2019s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions \u2013 GDI and Nod \u2013 inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world\u2019s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Epic Conclusion of the Saga - Kane returns in the thrilling conclusion to one of gaming\u2019s longest running storylines, told through gritty live-action cinematics.

In the first visit to the mansion, taking place within Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst, players explored the haunted dwelling and pieced together the mystery of the mansion's now-deceased namesake. In Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst, The Queen has summoned the player back to the now-decrepit mansion to shed some light on the manor's dark past and put the mysteries of Ravenhearst to rest. \nOnce you return to the manor, you will discover that there is more to the mansion than meets the eye, there is still a section of the manor unexplored, and some parts that you have already explored that have been refurbished by Charles' tormented spirit. You must now uncover the secret of what happened to Charles after he murdered Emma, and put a stop to his psychotic obsession once and for all. You must also discover what happened to Rose after Charles murdered Emma then search for her body hidden in the manor and free her spirit. \nAs you go through the mansion you find out that Charles took Rose and her two daughters and has them in coffins with tubes in them for a reason. through the course of the game you find out Charles has a machine, powered by the souls of Rose and her daughters, that is keeping him alive in the present day. It is also revealed that he had raped Rose, which led to the birth of his son, Victor.

Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies to try and kill him. \n \n \n \nInside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is a superhero (\"the chosen one\") who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch's protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus' evil plans and find a way out of this comic world before his own creations erase him for good. \n \n \n \nThe game has two possible endings. At the end of the game, Alissa attempts to defuse a Nuke, when Mortus comes into the comic and throws her into the chamber, which starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch. If the player defeats Mortus and the Kreeps he summons quickly enough to drain the liquid and save Alissa, an ending occurs where Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch. Comix Zone is a huge success, being sold out on its first day, and Alissa joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States. Roadkill is given a vast amount of mozzarella cheese, and spends a lot of time exploring the city's new sewer system when not sleeping under a pile of Sketch's dirty socks. \n \n \n \nIf the player defeats Mortus after the chamber fills with liquid, Alissa dies. Sketch comes out, but his comic is destroyed. The last sentence in the cutscene says \"Will Sketch recreate his adventure for a happier ending?\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yyzzcbgk8hg1vufsltud.jpg", "width": 500, "cloudinary_id": "yyzzcbgk8hg1vufsltud", "height": 370}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xscxlzwjyxn8wuj4d2gf.jpg", "width": 500, "cloudinary_id": "xscxlzwjyxn8wuj4d2gf", "height": 370}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t4sjyva2gwt7uzaftvaj.jpg", "width": 500, "cloudinary_id": "t4sjyva2gwt7uzaftvaj", "height": 370}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl6jkn2dpp7x3nopv3my.jpg", "width": 500, "cloudinary_id": "pl6jkn2dpp7x3nopv3my", "height": 370}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jjcgjnzbea7uvffyoh3h.jpg", "width": 500, "cloudinary_id": "jjcgjnzbea7uvffyoh3h", "height": 370}], "id": 3071}, {"genres": [25], "name": "Altered Beast", "videos": [{"video_id": "A57GZEJlxrc", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s4sb9fhddx31kd7rfhcq.jpg", "width": 220, "cloudinary_id": "s4sb9fhddx31kd7rfhcq", "height": 307}, "summary": "Unleash metamorphic power. \"Awaken, dead warrior!\" cries Zeus, God of Thunder.

The centurion is ordered by Zeus to save his daughter Athena from a Demon God called Neff in the Underworld. To become able to withstand the perils, the warrior gets the ability to absorb spirit balls which transform him into an Altered Beast, a part animal, part human creature of formidable force. Between each level are small animations giving the player glimpses of Athena's peril. He first travels through the graveyard fighting past zombies and winged demons. The centurion becomes a werewolf in order to fight Neff in the form of Aggar. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Underworld where he fights through giant leeches, Chinese dragon-headed rattlesnakes, and ferocious Chicken Stingers (resembling the ones from Golden Axe). The centurion turns into a humanoid thunder dragon in order to fight Neff in the form of Octeyes. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion travels through the Cavern of Souls where he fights through Cave Needles (which resemble giant ants), turtle/snail hybrids, and zombies known as Grave Masters. The centurion turns into a humanoid bear in order to fight Neff in the form of Mouldy Snail. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nThe centurion arrives at Neff's palace where he fights through zombies, Chicken Stingers, and Hammer Demons. The centurion turns into a humanoid tiger in order to fight Neff in the form of Crocodile Worm. The centurion defeats him, but Neff escapes. \nAfter the centurion arrives in Dis, he fights through winged demons, Goat Men, Boar Men, saw fishes, and purple Unicorn Men to get to Neff. When the centurion confronts Neff, the centurion becomes a golden werewolf while Neff transforms into a Rhinoceros-Man. After he is defeated, a blue bird comes out of the ground and transforms back to Athena. Afterwards she is shown holding arms with her lycanthropic hero, thanking him for rescuing her. \nIn the original arcade, the end credits are interspersed with images of actors in costumes for the different characters and monsters of the game, implying the whole game was a film production.[2]", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vtlhfdns3rjjdvl4mxhu.jpg", "width": 500, "cloudinary_id": "vtlhfdns3rjjdvl4mxhu", "height": 370}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tbzuwigixfgztnoqpudo.jpg", "width": 500, "cloudinary_id": "tbzuwigixfgztnoqpudo", "height": 370}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vhqdmh85lztldctpucpb.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "vhqdmh85lztldctpucpb", "height": 320}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mmtjq8nfwvhrjtscei7n.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "mmtjq8nfwvhrjtscei7n", "height": 448}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ylhhtzgxtht6ahnjq86z.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "ylhhtzgxtht6ahnjq86z", "height": 224}], "id": 2604}, {"genres": [5], "name": "Crack Down", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/quldcxgyd6mxor8o74ub.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "quldcxgyd6mxor8o74ub", "height": 780}, "summary": "Ben and Andy, the two top Special Service agents have accepted a very dangerous assignment \u2013 the elimination of Mr.K and his Artificial Life System.

As the title suggests, a large portion of the game consists of stealth, staking out targets and firing sniper rifles. Bullet trajectories are subject to wind, gravity and flight time, all of which players must account for when taking shots. To simplify this procedure, easier difficulty settings contain indicators that highlight enemies and show precisely where a bullet will hit. \n \nThe main weapons used in the game are silenced pistols, knives and various types of sniper rifles. In missions that are played with characters who are not snipers, the stealth aspect is dropped in favor of faster-paced \"run and gun\" scenarios. An exception to this are spotting missions, in which the primary objective consists of marking targets for a computer-controlled sniper character. \n \nMost of the game takes place in a dense jungle environment. Waypoint overlays at all times display the correct routes through the areas players must traverse. While these routes need not be followed exactly, the level design usually ensures an overall linear path due to obstacle placement and invisible walls. Many waypoints trigger scripted mission events, and some waypoints act as checkpoints, which automatically save the game. \n \nThe single player campaign of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is made up of four separate acts, each of which deals with a different conflict. All acts are split up into various missions, which usually depict the same event from different points of view. For example, in one segment players may be participating in an infantry assault on an enemy camp, while the next segment has them assuming the role of a supporting sniper who backs up the assault. There is downloadable content available for the title that seamlessly continues the story line with three additional campaign missions.", "storyline": "In the game, players take the role of various characters for different missions. Among them are a sniper, Sergeant Tyler \"Razor Six-Four\" Wells, for long range missions and stealth assignments, a Delta Force operator, Private Cole Anderson, as well as a rebel, El Tejon, for missions involving direct firefights. The main plot centers around a highly trained special ops unit that is sent into the fictional country of Isla Trueno, whose democratic government has been overthrown by a hostile force. \n \nUndercover CIA Agent Mike Rodriguez infiltrates the entourage of General Vasquez in order to set up a shot for the sniper-spotter team Alpha Nine. Killing the general would put an end to the regime on Isla Trueno. During the assassination attempt, Agent Rodriguez is compromised and captured, and General Vasquez escapes. After a series of missions, the assault team Delta Three, supported by sniper unit Razor Six Four, manages to free Agent Rodriguez from an enemy camp. \n \nWith Vasquez on the loose, Delta Three and Razor Six-Four are sent to set up an air strike on a cocaine plantation. After the successful destruction of the plantation, the evacuation chopper comes under attack and has to leave. Razor Six Four makes his way through enemy territory in order to reach the new evacuation point from where he is extracted. \n \nAgent Rodriguez teams up with Sergeant Tyler Wells to steal plans of a nuclear warhead from an enemy camp. The mission is a success, but Agent Rodriguez turns out to be a traitor. He takes the data and leaves Sergeant Wells to be shot by the enemy. A rebel leader called El Tejon rescues Sergeant Wells, who then tracks down Rodriguez, kills him and retrieves the data. \n \nBecause the data files are incomplete, the Alpha Nine sniper-spotter team steals the rest of the data from the enemy. Together with Razor Six Four, Alpha Nine then eliminates Ernesto Salazar, General Vasquez' advisor. Decryption of the stolen data uncovers the location of a secret uranium mine on Isla Trueno.

It was also released in addition to a series of other Sega games, including Shining Force and Comix Zone, in Sega Smash Pack 2. The game has also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.", "storyline": "The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \"main path\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \"Elsewhere\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. \n \nAs Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that transform him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying amounts of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava or touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w5sb7wxizz2svpunkgdx.jpg", "width": 456, "cloudinary_id": "w5sb7wxizz2svpunkgdx", "height": 338}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yijwinjyiu6btuq4cesh.jpg", "width": 960, "cloudinary_id": "yijwinjyiu6btuq4cesh", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eyhg2peyl8qsngynoeze.jpg", "width": 550, "cloudinary_id": "eyhg2peyl8qsngynoeze", "height": 300}], "id": 16035}, {"genres": [9, 15], "name": "Columns", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kwuzpbc2pbmh9nyf6pjz.jpg", "width": 1536, "cloudinary_id": "kwuzpbc2pbmh9nyf6pjz", "height": 2100}, "summary": "Go back in time to a bygone civilization: the ancient world of Phoenicia.

The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion. \n \nAll of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO. \n \nWhen dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons. \n \nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low. \n \nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.", "storyline": "Vicious predators from the far ends of the universe are invading our planet!

Controls are simple, with the game largely consisting of running, jumping and punching. Levels are made up of various types of blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes, and also feature hazards such as water and deadly creatures. \nThe main mode in the game is Adventure Mode, which can be played solo or co-operatively with a second player. During co-operative play, players are able to work together to overcome obstacles, which includes throwing them across gaps, using their heads as platforms and helping each other up ledges, although there is just as much opportunity to sabotage your partner. Adventure mode consists of various worlds each with a set of levels. In order to progress to the next world, players need to collect gems which can also be used to unlock new customiseable parts. Players can also collect balls of yarn which they can use to bribe cat guards and unlock new weapons, such as frisbees and vacuum cleaners. Collecting all gems and the yarn will get you an A++ in the level and two extra gems. Arena mode is a competitive mode for up to four players, which can be played free-for-all or in teams. There are several match types including: \nSoul: Steal enemy soul and run away. Capture and hold the enemy's souls to gain points. Kill a soul-carrier to release their souls to roam the level. \nMuckle: Beat and kill the enemy team to earn your team points. \nChallenge: Score the best time on a given level. \nKing Of The Hill: Stand on the crown blocks to gain your team points. \nColor The World: Color more blocks than the other team. \nGrab The Gold: Grab more gold from the golden whale than the other team and deposit it in the flying safe to score points for your team \nBall Game: Get the ball in the basket. \nHorse: Ride the opposing team's horse to your stables to gain points for your team. \nAlong with a Time Attack mode, the game also features a Level Editor, which allows players to create their own stages for any game type. These levels can be assembled into a playlist, consisting of various Adventure and Arena levels, and uploaded to the community for others to download. There is also additional content unlocked for players who also own Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid HD.[3][4]", "storyline": "Almost all of the game's cut-scenes are done in a stick puppet style. The game begins with the narrator (played by Will Stamper) telling the adventures of the hundreds of friends aboard the S.S. Friendship, as well as Hatty Hattington, who is known as \"best friend to one and all\". After encountering a heavy storm, the S.S. Friendship becomes shipwrecked on a mysterious, seemingly abandoned island, and the crew itself vanishes. Upon waking up from the wreck, the player character seeks shelter from the storm in a dilapidated theater. Soon afterwards, the player discovers technologically advanced, highly-evolved cats restraining a captive Hatty as he is being fitted with an ominously glowing top hat. The hat appears to change him, and he alerts the cats to the player's presence, attacking them and rendering them unconscious. \nUpon coming to, it is revealed that the entire crew of the S.S. Friendship is being held prisoner by the cats, with Hatty as their apparent new leader. The player is then released from their cell and forced into deadly games by the feline wardens. The cats, who force their prisoners into deadly theater performances, watch with amusement as the player fights for their survival. As the player completes challenges, they find gems which are spend on unlocking fellow crew members to play as in these theater performances. Appearing to be possessed by the hat's unknown powers, Hatty begins working for the cats and against the player. \nAs the player progresses, the narrator reveals more about the theater. Hundreds of years before the player shipwrecked on the island, Purrham Furbottom, a theatrical aficionado, sought to build the world's greatest theater. The opening night saw the most jaw-dropping feats and thrills the likes of which were never seen before, making the theater an overnight success. However, Furbottom did not allow intermissions in the theater, and after an untold amount of time watching the show, he died after \"pooping himself to death on the way to the bathroom.\" Since then, his top hat has been passed down to various others, who were each revered by the cats as their leader, and who each met with grim fates of their own. The hat, the narrator theorizes, is haunted by the grief and sorrow of each of its past wearers, and Hatty is its current victim, having sunk into a depression while being surrounded by the many gems the player has accrued, without doing anything to help the state of the theater. \nEventually, the cats grow tired of Hatty's inaction, and begin rioting, striking, and more, while the player's challenges grow increasingly difficult. As the theater deteriorates further, the narrator provides encouragement to the player, and continues to shed light on the cats' mental state, which grows more unstable as time progresses. The narrator also instructs the player to enter The Vault, which houses Hatty and all the gems the player has spent, before the cats kill Hatty and the rest of the crew, starting the madness over again. \nAfter completing the final set of challenges inside the Vault, the player breaks into Hatty's throne room. Hatty doesn't budge, so the player carries him out of the crumbling theater as the crew of the S.S. Friendship orchestrates a mass breakout. Everyone manages to make it back to the boat amidst the chaos, escaping the island and the cats that reside there. As the player celebrates with hot cocoa, he tries to cheer up Hatty, who the narrator implies has sunk into a catatonic state from prolonged exposure to the hat. The narrator sings a sad song as the credits roll, before quickly recovering and singing a more happy, upbeat song, rocking the boat and flinging Hatty into the sea, where he sinks to the bottom. The hat lands on his head and begins glowing green as opposed to its usual red, and shoots a beam skyward, where it sends the boat flying and continues into space, where it vaporizes a bear that appeared during the narrator's upbeat song. The narrator claims to understand what just happened, but does not explain, sending the game back to the title screen.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d60y2bfxrfrxbxiyeyxj.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "d60y2bfxrfrxbxiyeyxj", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/edtzw5ddlu78xut1bxip.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "edtzw5ddlu78xut1bxip", "height": 720}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cin95yxe1odusrimpgc8.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "cin95yxe1odusrimpgc8", "height": 562}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/javfeue3fqfzvztextxd.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "javfeue3fqfzvztextxd", "height": 562}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c1glrjlu56dcek6baxut.jpg", "width": 450, "cloudinary_id": "c1glrjlu56dcek6baxut", "height": 260}], "id": 2605}, {"genres": [12, 31, 32], "name": "The Lost Heir 3: Demon War", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xkedlhysr4vxdfiyifdp.jpg", "width": 408, "cloudinary_id": "xkedlhysr4vxdfiyifdp", "height": 272}, "summary": "Defeat the rampaging demon horde, save the Kingdom of Daria, and avenge the death of your parents in the thrilling conclusion to this epic three part series!

This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. \n \nWhile exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons. Red Hook refers to this as tactical camping because players have to distribute rations among their heroes, protect the camp from ambushes, and reduce the stress levels of the heroes, all costing actions points", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bpbibanvncacsvqn6fd9.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "bpbibanvncacsvqn6fd9", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xjddandpyntkbvftyyzi.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "xjddandpyntkbvftyyzi", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pssuu1i6lpaq2xvxjfii.jpg", "width": 1919, "cloudinary_id": "pssuu1i6lpaq2xvxjfii", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mdstzvgvdvcpgycaiftt.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "mdstzvgvdvcpgycaiftt", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rkz6ff4o3qhkumcaqhhi.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "rkz6ff4o3qhkumcaqhhi", "height": 1080}], "id": 8965}, {"screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qnacgkc1sa8qwtdmoz7m.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "qnacgkc1sa8qwtdmoz7m", "height": 720}], "id": 25651, "name": "Darkest Dungeon: The Crimson Court"}, {"genres": [15, 16, 31], "name": "BattleTech", "videos": [{"video_id": "IBJ7fbbTDA0", "name": "E3 2017 Showcase"}, {"video_id": "EfM9otjBSII", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mdeqyhinxuqkalxt7rkh.jpg", "width": 318, "cloudinary_id": "mdeqyhinxuqkalxt7rkh", "height": 410}, "summary": "BattleTech is a turn-based tactical 'Mech combat set in the classic 3025 era of the BattleTech Universe.

His love for food means he just can't help himself, whether the food belongs to him or not. \n \nNavigate many vibrant levels and help Bronut eat all the things! It's not all smooth eating though - beware of the watcher and the evil host! They're not really evil of course, after all it's their food... but anything that gets between Bronut and his treats is the enemy! \n \nThe watcher keeps watch on the stage with a spotlight, avoid it at all costs! Otherwise, the evil host will be alerted of your location and you will have to run and hide! Don't get caught! Be sure to make use of terrain and objects to hide from the spotlight. \n \nAs it goes, Bronut doesn't count his macros... he puts on weight with each snack, making him larger and slower. But putting on the weight can work out in your favour! You can weigh down big switches, reach higher places, resist high-speed winds, and much more! Be sure to visit your local TABLET station to \"unload\" when you need to! \n \nAs you progress through the game you will encounter new and interesting foods, such as colder than cold ice creams and the sweetest of sweet doughnuts. These may give you side-effects such as brain freeze (enabling you to walk on lava), and a sugar rush (increased run speed and jump height).", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ohrymrkakouivce2e44t.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "ohrymrkakouivce2e44t", "height": 224}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xq0ilfhhrvj0ztsyw12o.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "xq0ilfhhrvj0ztsyw12o", "height": 224}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d4u6orrubjsgjskviw0l.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "d4u6orrubjsgjskviw0l", "height": 224}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xorjlzc21l308kmtk8pm.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "xorjlzc21l308kmtk8pm", "height": 224}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbxrv2hveat7udgx3mr3.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "jbxrv2hveat7udgx3mr3", "height": 224}], "id": 54724}]
