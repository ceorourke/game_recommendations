Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle). \n\nCombat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jdi0sw1n4zrtfqi5rmo4.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "jdi0sw1n4zrtfqi5rmo4", "height": 200}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fdd4iuuanyoir0pehjmy.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "fdd4iuuanyoir0pehjmy", "height": 200}], "id": 1896}, {"genres": [5], "name": "Rambo III", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z0a3iqwniwzwv5ialiea.jpg", "width": 566, "cloudinary_id": "z0a3iqwniwzwv5ialiea", "height": 739}, "summary": "Rambo III is a series of video games based on the film of the same name.

It opens with the investigation of the recent murder of Renee Stein, the third victim of a serial killer known as \"The Ripper\", largely out of the modus operandi similarity to Jack the Ripper. The player assumes the role of Jake Quinlan, a reporter for the Virtual Herald, whom The Ripper sends messages to detailing his murders (an act attributed to Jack the Ripper, although no letters have been proven to come from him). Along with the police (whose investigation is headed by Detective Vincent Magnotta), Quinlan is seeking The Ripper's true identity.\n\nAfter investigating Renee Stein's murder, Quinlan receives a message from The Ripper, who warns Quinlan that his girlfriend, Catherine Powell, will be the next victim, as she has gotten too close to discovering his identity. Quinlan manages to find Powell still alive, but in a coma \"deeper than anyone thought possible.\" Cybersurgeon Claire Burton at the Meta-Cognition Center of the Tribeca Center Hospital manages to retrieve a distorted image of Powell's attacker, but requires additional information from Quinlan to make it clearer. (This is also a reference to Jack the Ripper, as the police hypothesized that they might be able to get an image of the killer from the retinas of the victims.) He provides this through investigating into what Powell was on to in her investigation and homes in on three possible suspects for The Ripper's murders. In order to transmit this information into Powell's brain directly, he enlists the help of Joey Falconetti, a hacker who specializes in interfacing directly with the human brain.\n\nQuinlan's investigation leads him to discover that all of The Ripper's victims and all of those associated with the investigation of The Ripper (except Quinlan himself) were involved with an old gaming group known as the Web Runners, who played a game based on the Jack the Ripper mystery. The last session of this game somehow caused one of the players to die in real life. The player that died happened to be Catherine Powell's mother. Assistance from a pathologist named Vic Farley reveals that The Ripper's murders were done by placing a code into a victim's brain while in cyberspace that caused their internal body pressure to rise to a point of explosion, which Farley experiences immediately after providing his explanation. Quinlan also finds a cyberspace weapon developed by a murdered cyberarchitect named Hamilton Wofford, designed specifically to kill The Ripper inside a virtual recreation of the historic Whitechapel district of London, where the Jack the Ripper murders took place. After assembling the weapon and gathering the necessary protection from The Ripper's weapon, Quinlan enters cyberspace, kills The Ripper, and manages to escape the virtual Whitechapel in time to escape its destruction.\n\nThe Ripper can be one of four possible suspects: Joey Falconetti, Claire Burton, Vincent Magnotta, or Catherine Powell. With each play-through, certain clues and actual identity of The Ripper vary, though the bulk of the story is unchanged, and clues indicating the guilt of all four suspects will appear regardless of who the killer is. For instance, Catherine Powell experiences mysterious surges in brain wave activity that coincide with all the Ripper's murders regardless of whether or not she actually is the Ripper, and no alternative explanation for these surges is provided. However, the changes in the game's story and puzzles are limited to the game's third act- after Farley's death.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxo1ghlmo5y9laiho1r2.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "jxo1ghlmo5y9laiho1r2", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a0g8s8zjivbaxuk4wmoy.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "a0g8s8zjivbaxuk4wmoy", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j5f6kddrtlgph0wcnwpk.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "j5f6kddrtlgph0wcnwpk", "height": 480}], "id": 6829}, {"genres": [13, 31], "name": "Deus", "videos": [{"video_id": "QYL14fwp_kc", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nmjhjraal5bjmdqe8gk8.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "nmjhjraal5bjmdqe8gk8", "height": 869}, "summary": "Deus is a survival Simulation Game, and the sequel to Robinson's Requiem.

Each society's gradual expansion eventually led to an historic meeting in a backwater region of space known as the Spinward Marches.\n\nAlthough their human physical appearances were exactly alike, several fundamental differences existed between the two great powers. The Zhodani's political structure was strictly authoritarian, whereas the Imperium was governed by the rule of the Emperor, a classic aristocracy. As the Zhodani race evolved, the human brain's potential was explored and mastered until the use of powerful psionics was a way of life. Mind-reading, telekinesis, extrasensory perception and clairvoyance became common among the Zhodani. The Imperium disdainfully outlawed the use of any form of psionics, believing these strange powers to be an invasion of mental privacy. Also, because the Zhodani utilized their superior mental ability in everyday life, many Imperial traders and merchants grew suspicious of their motives and avoided negotiations with the Zhodani.\nThe Imperial race, lacking psionics, saw its development grow along creative, artistic and emotional paths. And as with any creative society, wondrous achievement and joy was often coupled with imperfections and greed. The Zhodani - viewing the Imperial race as dishonest, morally corrupt, weak and insecure - lived highly structured and unemotional lifestyles. With two powerful societies so clearly opposed in political and social beliefs, confrontation was inevitable.\n\nAs the Zhodani continued to expand into the Spinward Marches, many worlds were peacefully integrated into the Zhodani Consulate. However, several independent worlds resisted the Zhodani, believing that they would lose their freedom and be forced to live under restrictive rule. The Spinward Marches became an intergalactic 'hot spot' and the aggressive advances of the Zhodani led to the first of several conflicts known as the Frontier Wars,the first of which began in 589 - 89 years after the two great powers first established contact.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bywzv1wlqgno1raet9bg.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "bywzv1wlqgno1raet9bg", "height": 256}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nzifj7id4yoowyeytrgh.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "nzifj7id4yoowyeytrgh", "height": 256}], "id": 12678}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oc2kowmxldecanpynb5b.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "oc2kowmxldecanpynb5b", "height": 785}, "genres": [31], "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jqzl3sn08dltmc4jpbib.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "jqzl3sn08dltmc4jpbib", "height": 256}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vi6cbcsz8k0alxlhpzfx.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "vi6cbcsz8k0alxlhpzfx", "height": 256}], "id": 12690, "name": "Mystery of the Mummy"}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xt5hir0wb3g516x4qdfy.jpg", "width": 630, "cloudinary_id": "xt5hir0wb3g516x4qdfy", "height": 806}, "genres": [10], "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tafrfz1bifb9nisayvyj.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "tafrfz1bifb9nisayvyj", "height": 256}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i9sc79of03xjsisy1le6.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "i9sc79of03xjsisy1le6", "height": 256}], "id": 12686, "name": "Moonshine Racers"}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gixxlhcnra29iwpx6agk.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "gixxlhcnra29iwpx6agk", "height": 831}, "genres": [12], "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rnmyuht1wn9byaga5eiw.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "rnmyuht1wn9byaga5eiw", "height": 256}], "id": 12654, "name": "The Keys to Maramon"}, {"genres": [12, 15, 24, 31, 33], "name": "Midwinter", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jw2mtkvavi1rypwqcqce.jpg", "width": 630, "cloudinary_id": "jw2mtkvavi1rypwqcqce", "height": 728}, "summary": "Midwinter is a post-apocalyptic first-person action role-playing game with strategy and survival elements for the Atari ST, Amiga and PC.

In later versions of the game, she is still in the hospital and explores further, until taken by a small metallic entity to the castle. \n \nUnwilling to give up her search, Laura continues through the dark corridors of the medieval hall. While attempting to find her father, she experiences a series of flashbacks of her mother being stabbed to death. Laura's father (taking the form of apparitions) warns her to leave, saying that staying too long means being stuck in the alternate reality forever. He warns that he will soon become an emotionless monster and will eventually try to kill her. Still shaken, Laura proceeds to find her father residing at the peak tower of the castle. Angrily, the father reveals the sordid past of his family: Laura and her father are part of a bloodline with an insatiable appetite for human flesh, dating back to the infamous Dracula. Laura had killed and eaten her mother years ago, but it was erased from her memory by her father. As Dr. Harris begins to transform into a vampire, Laura has to make a choice: kill or be killed.

Cities are connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background info \u2013 e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture. \n \nLearning to place countries and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features of the target country and town which help narrow down your options \u2013 e.g. \u201cIt\u2019s an island country\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s in East Asia\u201d etc. The first player to visit the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base for a points reward. \n \nFor each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400 possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe trotters.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vhnhnbvazq09icwmvh6w.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "vhnhnbvazq09icwmvh6w", "height": 200}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r1x3gexv0t8qwma8srgc.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "r1x3gexv0t8qwma8srgc", "height": 200}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rvzohhksiwuzqoh9qlad.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "rvzohhksiwuzqoh9qlad", "height": 256}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jf6ddsst7fqv11z4rbtf.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "jf6ddsst7fqv11z4rbtf", "height": 256}], "id": 14356}, {"genres": [5], "name": "Capone", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kewqygxiostmcrpmmbdd.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "kewqygxiostmcrpmmbdd", "height": 801}, "summary": "The 20's in Chicago was a rough time.

A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection. \n \nThe game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world. \n \nThe player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the \"Alert Mode.\" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery: \n \nIf Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen. \nHowever, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator. \nThe player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters. \n \nThe enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank. \n \nA transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer).

The special forces unit FOXHOUND sends top agent Gray Fox to infiltrate the fortress, assess the situation and neutralize the threat. FOXHOUND loses contact with Gray Fox a few days later, with his last transmission being \"METAL GEAR...\" To discover what happened to Gray Fox, FOXHOUND commander Big Boss sends his newest recruit, Solid Snake, into the area in an operation codenamed Intrude N313. \n \nUpon insertion into Outer Heaven, Snake makes contact with local resistance members Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer. Using all of his skills and the equipment he procures on site, he manages to rescue Fox. Fox explains that Metal Gear is the codename of a nuclear-equipped bipedal walking tank, which can engage in all forms of combat and launch nuclear weapons from any location. Outer Heaven plans to use Metal Gear to impose itself as the new world superpower. \n \nTo destroy Metal Gear and topple the Outer Heaven mercenaries, Snake rescues lead Metal Gear engineer Dr. Pettrovich Madnar and his daughter Ellen. The scientist explains how Metal Gear can be destroyed, and Snake takes on Outer Heaven's troops. However, he begins to notice that traps put in his way are too precise, and wonders how information on his activities are being tracked. Big Boss begins to act strangely and eventually tells Snake to abort the mission (breaking the fourth wall by telling the player to turn off the console). Moreover, Schneider is ambushed by hostiles and is presumed dead after losing contact with Snake. \n \nSnake penetrates Outer Heaven's main base and takes out Metal Gear before it reaches completion. As he safely escapes the compound's basement, he is confronted by the mercenary leader of Outer Heaven, who turns out to be Big Boss. The corrupt leader reveals that he had been using his connections to steal military intelligence, establish his own mercenary force, and fund his activities. It was his aim to have Outer Heaven become the world's greatest superpower, able to bring even the West to its knees.

Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the passage that he wishes to unlock. As usual, ghosts will keep chasing Pac around the maze until he has lost all his lives. However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the ghosts quickly.\n\nThere are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only last for a number of seconds. During the time that he is enlarged, a flashing star will appear besides two boxes that are located in the middle of the maze. The first box will display the current fruit or prize, and the other will display a rotating selection of them. If Pac manages to eat the star when they match there will be a large bonus score.\n\nOccasionally, after three or more stages, there will be a bonus stage where Pac automatically gets enlarged.

There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level. \n \nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town. \n \nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food.

First of all were the social norms of Green-Sky. Theft and violence were alien concepts to most of the books' characters. Therefore, one could not (as is common with adventure games) simply walk into a room and pocket an unattended object. One had to find the owner of the object and ask permission, buy the object with money (called tokens) in a shop, or locate the object in a public area. In the books, the Kindar economy was a moneyless quasi-communism; it was the Erdlings who used tokens and were used to being able to buy whatever they could afford. \n \nParticularly interesting was the extremely low level of violence in the game. The player could be hurt only by falling, coming into contact with snakes or tree spiders (invented for the game), or walking into walls. These incidents merely resulted in a jarring \"bump\" sound effect and an animation of the character crouching and rubbing their head, as if recovering from a nasty knock, rather than any gruesome or graphic injury. Even the occasional adversary did not hurt one's character grievously, although one did slowly lose health points and game time, and might find oneself sent back to one's nid-place (house) with an ominous notice that \"you were found unconscious.\" \n \nAlternately, your character could be kidnapped and held prisoner by the racist factions of the Salite or Nekom in one of the two \"prison houses\" in the game. A player with no other way to escape these prisons (or who found themselves otherwise trapped) could \"renew\", which was essentially a process of slipping briefly into a sort of recuperative coma, which resulted, as with the loss of all health points, in a loss of game time and the character returning to their nid-place (again, assuring that the character could never actually die during the game). \n \nIn the Nekom \"prison house,\" you could find a machete (called a \"wand of Befal\" after Axon Befal, the Erdling faction's leader, but its primary use was to cut thick vegetation. If you killed people with this blade, there were serious, permanent penalties to your abilities. Taking lives would essentially make the game unwinnable, which is consistent with the themes expressed in the original story. \n \nIt was among the first games that offered a choice of multiple protagonists, as well as a choice of gender, age, race, and beginning level of psychic powers (referred to as \"Spirit-skills\"). Furthermore, people treated the characters differently based on your choice of avatar. A child character could be invited to play. Erdling characters could be given a chilly reception at some Kindar houses and vice versa. Consistent with the books, these people were portrayed as being opposed to any alliances between the two cultures, and thus had to be avoided whenever possible. Pensing to read thoughts and emotions when encountering a stranger provided clues to their attitudes and distinguished friend from foe. While the game's technology limited the extent of these features, they were certainly present. \n \nAnother interesting detail is that the vegetarian Kindar characters did not get much nutrition out of eating meat, and temporarily lost psychic abilities. Likewise, the narcotic Wissenberries were somewhat more health-damaging to Erdling characters. In the books, Kindar \u2014 even children \u2014 often used the berries in rituals and ceremony, as well as recreationally, and for relief of physical and emotional pain. \n \nMost of the gameplay focused on the challenges of getting the character to move around the game world. Various objects in the game were used for this. Of primary importance was the shuba, a flying-squirrel-like garment which allows the character to glide diagonally instead of falling, and also prevented the character from being hurt by falls. Along the way, one learns a variety of \"Spirit skills\" or psychic abilities of progressive difficulty. The Spirit-skills, which included telepathy (called \"pensing\"), telekinesis (called \"kiniporting\") and the ability to make tree branches grow to create temporary bridges across impassible gaps (\"grunspreking\") are the key to making progress in the game world and achieving the ultimate goal. Communicating with animals as well as people through telepathy is vital to enhancing the character's Spirit-skills. \n \nThe graphics were exquisitely colored, highly advanced for the time. Users have described the deeply evocative and compelling qualities of the images as being one of the main reasons they kept playing. Snyder's husband Larry wrote a number of bell-like musical phrases very much in the style of the choral chant important to both cultures as described in the books. As in today's games, these pieces are heard when an important discovery is made or the player gains important skills or advances. \n \nThe game is a direct sequel to the books, and is meant by the author to be taken as canon. It originated in Snyder's realization that one of her final plot elements had been a huge mistake. She was being flooded with mail from adults and children, but could not see any way to change the ending now that the book was on the market. In addition, she had believed the event she described to be necessary to the ultimate resolution of the plot. Introduced to the concept of computer games, Snyder saw a way to redeem the situation while keeping and even advancing the original plot. The object of the game is to solve the mystery of what really happened.", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbse6nsqkynw496yedui.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "jbse6nsqkynw496yedui", "height": 1138}, "id": 13813, "name": "Below the Root"}, {"genres": [31], "summary": "You are Arthur Dent, an Englishman with a bad hangover wearing a dressing gown containing a much needed buffered analgesic and some fluff.

For example, the first race, titled \"Practice\", is a simple course that is much shorter than the others, while the fifth race, named \"Silly\", features polka-dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite from the other courses", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hoi8b4t1vbnauuojc1xj.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "hoi8b4t1vbnauuojc1xj", "height": 256}], "id": 2246}, {"genres": [31], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rbqllibjq0rnmgeicawm.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "rbqllibjq0rnmgeicawm", "height": 1386}, "id": 25859, "name": "The Tracer Sanction"}, {"genres": [9, 15, 24], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zdl7qgol4of7bo1mpogw.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "zdl7qgol4of7bo1mpogw", "height": 1508}, "id": 25860, "name": "Felony!"}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d98mc7rr2qqt8ezoglei.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "d98mc7rr2qqt8ezoglei", "height": 677}, "genres": [31], "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/trnxclzadd9lgcm1gagh.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "trnxclzadd9lgcm1gagh", "height": 256}], "id": 12185, "name": "Mindshadow"}, {"genres": [14], "summary": "Hat Trick is an ice hockey based arcade game released by Bally Sente in 1984.

The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.\n\nThe game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.\n\nControlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.\n\nDelivering the papers\nThe paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.\n\n\nIn Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street.\nThe primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.\n\nKeeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.\n\nThe player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.\n\nThere are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.\n\nAlong the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.\n\nA 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.\n\n\nTraining course\nPaperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker.\nThe end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.\n\n\nFinish line bug\nA bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.\n\nRecapping the delivery\nThe next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.\n\nThe game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.\n\nLosing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"\n\nThe arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.\n\n\nPORTS:\nPaperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.\n\nUnlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.\n\nMore recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003.\nA Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.\n\nPaperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.\n\nAn iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s29dx0vdizqqbw5vpxbl.jpg", "width": 512, "cloudinary_id": "s29dx0vdizqqbw5vpxbl", "height": 384}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hz9edpqsrkywr9ci1b4y.jpg", "width": 512, "cloudinary_id": "hz9edpqsrkywr9ci1b4y", "height": 384}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/idugnjxjvjttyane7bhl.jpg", "width": 1440, "cloudinary_id": "idugnjxjvjttyane7bhl", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pvgwxx6im9gxwopvrtr7.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "pvgwxx6im9gxwopvrtr7", "height": 448}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nsoegta4imoyaeztqif4.jpg", "width": 259, "cloudinary_id": "nsoegta4imoyaeztqif4", "height": 194}], "id": 11762}, {"genres": [13, 31], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pfqhkz0zdowhmsn5mro3.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "pfqhkz0zdowhmsn5mro3", "height": 1386}, "id": 25888, "name": "Wilderness: A Survival Adventure"}, {"cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/drfwflf6vpyngd2bgyed.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "drfwflf6vpyngd2bgyed", "height": 1428}, "genres": [13], "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kjr2v208qxoq7lotq8t4.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "kjr2v208qxoq7lotq8t4", "height": 226}], "id": 12244, "name": "Super Huey UH-1X"}, {"genres": [31], "summary": "You are a space pilot who can travel through time.

On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, further adding to the challenge. \n \nThe wizard himself is not capable of collecting paint droplets, and is initially capable of very limited movement, bouncing up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after next touching the ground. Collecting green pearls (which appear when some sprites have been shot) gives the player tokens which can be used to \"buy\" enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower, and also a companion known as Catellite. Catellite (ostensibly the wizard's cat) is also spherical in form. It normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which also renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets; the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player. As well as droplets of colours, sometimes droplets of other colours also appear, having various effects. These include: \n \nLight blue - causes a \"filth raid\", where a wave of fast-moving enemies appear, shooting bullets at the player. \nGrey - changes Catellite into an \"Indestructacat\", making it invulnerable to enemies. \nWhite - gives an extra life. \nPurple - changes Catellite into a \"mutant cat\", causing it to disobey the player's controls. \nBlack - causes \"freaky bits\", turning most of the scenery black.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ashbpze3j72ihbovl9ms.jpg", "width": 320, "cloudinary_id": "ashbpze3j72ihbovl9ms", "height": 256}], "id": 12234}, {"genres": [15, 24], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zm3u3wydf4msama94rxf.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "zm3u3wydf4msama94rxf", "height": 1381}, "id": 46659, "name": "Vermeer"}, {"genres": [8, 15, 33], "name": "Bubble Bobble", "videos": [{"video_id": "ZVLcmx7kW7s", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fvvjot97a8ia4xwzjy3i.jpg", "width": 352, "cloudinary_id": "fvvjot97a8ia4xwzjy3i", "height": 494}, "summary": "In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob.

These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas.

A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence). \n \nAfter a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements.

They sent a ship, named \"Exodus\" to colonize this new planet with explorers, embryos and supplies. Generations passed, and the colony on Evath was formed. Without the rule of law, the oldest members of the Exodus' crew, the Elders, were forced to take control, form an army and bring the rule of law to Evath. \n \nLesleigh Skerrit aspired to work for the Driller Federation.

He wanted to study law to prevent this kind of mistake happening again. \n \nCalled in by his superior, Montigue Yarbro, he is offered a lifetime opportunity - to complete his training and gain a promotion to Elite within the Driller Federation in one fell swoop. His experience on Mitral bore him well - he was to go to Mitral and attempt to avert the coming catastrophe.

The player starts each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which he/she has to protect from attacks by Japanese planes.

The weapons to complete these objectives, besides machine guns, are a limited number of bombs, rockets and torpedoes. On some missions, the player must also sink Japanese vessels, such as destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. The player has a finite amount of fuel and munitions, which can be replenished by returning to the carrier.
