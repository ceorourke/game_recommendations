The Queen of England has enlisted the character's help to solve the mystery behind the ghostly apparitions in and around Ravenhearst manor. The player character is provided the recently acquired diary belonging to Emma Ravenhearst which holds the key to unraveling the history of this unsettling place, yet some pages are missing. The player must venture into Ravenhearst, find the missing pages, and solve the mystery. \nAs the player collects the pages of the diary, the story reveals itself. Emma Ravenhearst, a young girl from Iowa, arrived in Blackpool, England on August 24, 1894 after having been graduated from a teacher's college. She is hired at a local school and boards with the schoolmistress, also helping with household tasks. \nAt a community autumn party on September 10, 1894, Emma meets a handsome, wealthy young man named Charles Dalimar. He is smitten by Emma. Several months later, on March 16, 1895 he proposes to Emma. \nAfter thinking about the fact that she has, as she says in her diary, just begun her life, she declines the proposal. Charles is hurt, but two weeks later on April 5, 1895 he visits Emma again, carrying roses. He tells her that he has purchased a tract of land and is building a manor. \nA workman, Frank Williams, falls while working on the house in May 1895.. He leaves behind a wife and two children. At the funeral, Charles mutters to Emma something about being forever alone at his \"bedevilled\" manor. \nOn May 23, Emma gets a letter from her sister back in America telling her that their father is seriously ill. She makes plans to leave, but then falls ill. As she worsens, Charles moves her into the manor and cares for her. \nHe hires a woman named Rose Somerset to take care of Emma. Emma, despite her condition, continues to write in her diary and she and Rose become friends. (Note: source for edits to this point come directly from the diary in the Ravenhearst game.) \nUnfortunately, Emma's health keeps on failing. She starts having nightmares where she is wearing a white bridal dress. She has not heard anything from her family. Charles behaviour has become suspicious & he has taken to reading the books of black magic & necromancy. Rose is finding the situation creepy. When Rose discovers a dress similar to the one Emma wore in her nightmare, the duo believe that Charles is trying to harm them. This also happens to be the second last entry in Emma's diary. \nThe last entry to the diary is dated \"Today\", and is written by the ghost of Emma, who haunts the manor. It urges the player to find seven skeleton keys hidden throughout the manor, and visit the cellar to open the cellar door with them.

In the first visit to the mansion, taking place within Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst, players explored the haunted dwelling and pieced together the mystery of the mansion's now-deceased namesake. In Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst, The Queen has summoned the player back to the now-decrepit mansion to shed some light on the manor's dark past and put the mysteries of Ravenhearst to rest. \nOnce you return to the manor, you will discover that there is more to the mansion than meets the eye, there is still a section of the manor unexplored, and some parts that you have already explored that have been refurbished by Charles' tormented spirit. You must now uncover the secret of what happened to Charles after he murdered Emma, and put a stop to his psychotic obsession once and for all. You must also discover what happened to Rose after Charles murdered Emma then search for her body hidden in the manor and free her spirit. \nAs you go through the mansion you find out that Charles took Rose and her two daughters and has them in coffins with tubes in them for a reason. through the course of the game you find out Charles has a machine, powered by the souls of Rose and her daughters, that is keeping him alive in the present day. It is also revealed that he had raped Rose, which led to the birth of his son, Victor. Eventually you discover a hidden room with the machine Charles uses to keep him alive and it is there you solve the final puzzle. \nIn the end of the very last puzzle, the warped and disfigured spirit of Charles Dalimar (preserved by souls in a tank) begins to deteriorate, ordering his son, Victor, to 'take the device (time machine), and run far, far, far away'. Victor gets away, meaning the entire Dalimar family is not yet extinguished. While the time machine launches, the disabled immortality machine explodes, setting Ravenhearst Manor ablaze. You and Victor are the only living persons to escape, as the souls of Emma, Rose, and the twins ascend from the conflagration which destroys the Estate. \nThe eighth game in the series, Mystery Case Files: Escape From Ravenhearst, continues the Ravenhearst story-arc.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n7outugyhohhouajf7dn.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "n7outugyhohhouajf7dn", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b7nqocojrew6hkscqzrz.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "b7nqocojrew6hkscqzrz", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/knlmcdvhuaywnjctsaya.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "knlmcdvhuaywnjctsaya", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m54yv25dgmk97ahgxwyr.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "m54yv25dgmk97ahgxwyr", "height": 600}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gf0wre6o9xhgckg8txim.jpg", "width": 800, "cloudinary_id": "gf0wre6o9xhgckg8txim", "height": 600}], "id": 5513}, {"genres": [9, 31], "name": "Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mqydanntyoxuu6mlokie.jpg", "width": 250, "cloudinary_id": "mqydanntyoxuu6mlokie", "height": 111}, "summary": "Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove is an interactive movie puzzle adventure game developed by Big Fish Studios, and distributed by Big Fish Games.

The player is driving through a decrepit town called Dire Grove, which appears to be deserted. The weather forecast has predicted a heavy snowstorm and the player has no other option but to explore the deserted town for shelter. The player sees an abandoned car and finds a camcorder in it. The footage shows a teenaged girl crying and pleading the player to save them. The player also finds a cryptic note: \"She is real. The legend is real.\".\nAs the player explores the surrounding, they realize that all the villagers have evacuated due to the snowstorm, so the player has to do everything by themself. The player learns that the girl in the footage is Alison Sterling, a collegiate who has chosen the Celtic legend of the Banshee as a subject for research. She arrived here with 3 friends and all four of them are missing. The player also learns that Dr. Patricia Anderson, an archaeologist had unearthed some relics only some days ago.\nThe player eventually learns about the legend of the Banshee. Apparently a farmer, a fisherman, a hunter and a blacksmith performed a ritual 1000 years ago to open a portal to talk to their kin in the spirit world. When the dead started attacking the living, they offered a young woman to appease the ghosts and close the portal. This woman became the Banshee and is trying to come back. The player also find that all the students have been subdued and hypnotized by the Banshee. Dr. Anderson's recording proves that the relics unearthed by her are maybe the keys to the portal.\nThe player is left with only one option: open the portal and send the Banshee back to the spirit world. Only after opening the portal the player realizes that the Banshee has tricked them into freeing her spirit. The player races against time, trapping the Banshee's spirit again and saved the students. In the end, Alison gives a lecture about the events at Dire Grove, where she is given by a big applause by a huge number of audience, including her friends. An audience member asks her about your identity, but she says: \"That person has asked to remain nameless, but I can give you their business card.\"\nShe flashes a card, and a Mystery Case Files logo is seen and the credits start rolling.", "id": 5514}, {"genres": [9, 31], "name": "Lego Marvel Super Heroes", "videos": [{"video_id": "sYAXHqCM-b4", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "tXN9OAJyKlA", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsxrv1ynjv8ifyc2wqav.jpg", "width": 750, "cloudinary_id": "dsxrv1ynjv8ifyc2wqav", "height": 861}, "summary": "Marvel Super Heroes are assembling for an action-packed, brick-smashing good time!

However, in the game's second case, Mia is murdered for being aware of corporate blackmail, and her younger sister Maya Fey is charged with the crime because her name was found on a piece of evidence. While defending her, Phoenix is reintroduced to another childhood friend, Miles Edgeworth, who is the prosecutor for Maya's case and has established himself as a \"genius\" for the prosecution system. Maya is found not guilty of the crime, and becomes Phoenix's assistant in further cases, offering her channeling ability as a \"Spirit Medium\" of Kurain village to bring the spirit of Mia to help at critical times. Phoenix and Edgeworth find that while they have their friendship from their youth, they continue to face off against each other in the courtroom. In the third case, Phoenix and Maya investigate the murder of a famous actor.In the fourth case, Edgeworth is charged with murder, and Phoenix steps up to defend him. It is discovered that Edgeworth was set up by his old mentor, Manfred von Karma. Several years earlier, Manfred shot and killed Edgeworth's father, a defense attorney, after he ruined Manfred's perfect record, but led Edgeworth to believe he shot his own father. Phoenix is able to expose Manfred's cover-up and achieve a \"not guilty\" verdict for Edgeworth. After the case, Edgeworth thinks about taking time off from his position to consider the events, while Maya announces she is going back to her home in Kurain Village to train. \nThe fifth case, added for the Nintendo DS, iOS, and Wii versions, has Ema Skye begging Wright for help to defend her older sister Lana, who is on trial for murder, compounded by a second murder of the same apparent victim in a different building at the same time. Using Ema's scientific help to establish evidence and the surprising prosecution help of Edgeworth during the trial, Phoenix is able to learn that Lana Skye was blackmailed by the Chief of Police Damon Gant into covering for a murder she thought that Ema had committed several years before. Gant himself is revealed to have committed the murder and pinned the blame on Ema. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she willingly goes to jail for being an accomplice; Ema says her goodbyes as she heads to Europe to study forensic science.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xh64jlnicza83gitsxgg.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "xh64jlnicza83gitsxgg", "height": 360}], "id": 1426}, {"genres": [12, 16, 31], "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Y", "videos": [{"video_id": "WNr6wQfNfK4", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "xMnwB6neGlY", "name": "Gameplay trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jdcw98rlqafnpu46lgi3.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "jdcw98rlqafnpu46lgi3", "height": 569}, "summary": "Your adventure in Pok\u00e9mon X and Pok\u00e9mon Y takes place in the Kalos region, home to beautiful skies and forests!

It was one of the earliest Game Boy titles, and was the first military-based game released for the Game Boy. On June 6, 2011, the game was re-released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console system via online distribution.\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis title has two different modes for one or two players. The player has several options to set up in both modes, in order to play in certain ways.\n\nGame-A\nThis mode is very similar to the pencil and paper game, Battleship, however, there is a storyline to it. The storyline follows the player destroying the enemies fleet on the first two levels and then proceeding to the enemies headquarters on the third level. On the third level, the enemy's vessels are replaced with a large runway and tanks.\n\nThere are also additional features that could be toggled to affect gameplay. First is the \"Near Miss\". If this feature is enabled, a shot directly next to a target ship will display a larger splash and play a beeping noise. Next, there are \"Lucky Shots\" which are randomly placed in empty grid squares. The Lucky Shots are split into two types; Black and White. A Black Lucky Shot will launch one missile, but if that missile hit a target ship, then it will instantly destroy that ship and any other ship touching it. A White Lucky Shot launches a silo of either five or nine missiles depending on the original grid size. There is a hindrance in this Lucky Shot, however, because only hits and misses are displayed on the players radar. If any of the salvo are Near Misses, then the player has to work out where the near misses are. Lastly, there is also an option which allows non-sunk aircraft carriers to launch an airplane mid-game. The airplane is only one square big, but moves around the aircraft carrier between turns.\n\nGame-B\nThis mode allows the player to set up his submarine with extra Prop Speed, shoot Twin Shots, and/or equip a Power Sonar, before battling against other ships. The player moves left or right slowly when above the ocean, while he moves faster when submerged. Players use the radar to locate their enemies and allies only when submerged. They can use the B-button to attack the enemy's submarine with a machine gun, while the player uses the A-button to send out torpedoes at all ships. When the player destroys every ship but the enemy's submarine or just destroys the enemy's submarine itself, he wins the game. The enemy's submarine isn't the only one that can attack and destroy the player in this mode, but also fighter jets take off from aircraft carriers, while dropping torpedoes at the player. Different animated endings pop up, depending on how much the player actually scores in the game.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jtqztguuxwc0etn1denx.jpg", "width": 543, "cloudinary_id": "jtqztguuxwc0etn1denx", "height": 236}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mkjfnzwkipmw58kamyvz.jpg", "width": 265, "cloudinary_id": "mkjfnzwkipmw58kamyvz", "height": 237}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e0uenkndkdxkxfhp02je.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "e0uenkndkdxkxfhp02je", "height": 360}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s3hyk8c8yxyhxazsl7h7.jpg", "width": 330, "cloudinary_id": "s3hyk8c8yxyhxazsl7h7", "height": 298}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fxfynoso93rnarazbeaf.jpg", "width": 315, "cloudinary_id": "fxfynoso93rnarazbeaf", "height": 285}], "id": 11688}, {"genres": [31, 33], "name": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth", "videos": [{"video_id": "Z6_C2ppkdVc", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "1aBb0M8HRCQ", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ww2wsxe06dljbui3m9fu.jpg", "width": 1920, "cloudinary_id": "ww2wsxe06dljbui3m9fu", "height": 1080}, "summary": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a top down, procedurally-generated rougelike game, remade based on the original game The Binding of Isaac.

Having such freedom lends itself to an overall richer gameplay experience in Alphadia. \n \nAs players learn to harness elementals in battle, they quickly become able to take advantage of their situation, and the thrill of battle increases.

It was developed by Shigeru Miyamoto. \n \nMario Bros. features two plumbers, Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers of New York after strange creatures have been appearing down there. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. The mechanics of Mario Bros. involve only running and jumping. Unlike future Mario games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen (in the old version along with an object called a \"POW\" block in the center). Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right and vice versa. \nThe player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing its speed to maximum. There are three enemies in all: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; and the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform. Players may also make use of the above-mentioned \"POW\" block, which flips any enemy touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. This item can be used three times before it disappears. Coins appear whenever enemies are defeated and may be collected for bonus points. \nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty.

Players navigate around the open world using the Nintendo 3DS' touchscreen to find and befriend various Yo-kai, which are scattered across the overworld. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. A new feature in battles is using the touch screen to find a particular sweetspot on an enemy Yo-kai to increase the likelihood of befriending it at the end of the battle, or other sweetspots for extra damage, extra money, or extra experience. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Crank-a-kai (Gasha Machine) by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game's main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended. When the player encounters a Yo-kai, he enters into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player's Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai's Soultimate abilities. While the original Yo-kai Watch featured nearly 250 Yo-kai, Yo-Kai Watch 2 features nearly 450, including several that were featured as bosses in the original game.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iwiukujxwekcnefzlo4b.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "iwiukujxwekcnefzlo4b", "height": 720}], "id": 11658}, {"genres": [12], "name": "Yo-Kai Watch 2: Psychic Specters", "videos": [{"video_id": "5dy2oDCuPuM", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w0l15jyknmm5bcha8jtf.jpg", "width": 1915, "cloudinary_id": "w0l15jyknmm5bcha8jtf", "height": 1732}, "summary": "The third version of Yo-kai Watch 2.

Out of the four stages in the game, the first, second and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of small fry enemies: one with fewer hit points and a stronger attack (usually armed with a weapon) and one with more hit points, but with a weaker attack and the ability to grab the player from behind, making him vulnerable to other enemies' attacks. \n \nWhen only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss is defeated, any remaining enemies retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down, and brings in the normal enemies once the bikers have been defeated. The third stage is a gang of women; their boss is a very large woman who cannot easily be knocked to the ground. The fourth stage features a single type of knife-wielding enemy who can kill the player with one hit. Once the player has defeated this first wave of enemies, the main character proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next cycle with an increased difficulty. \n \nIn addition to an eight-direction joystick, there are three buttons; left attack, right attack, and jump. Pressing the attack in the direction the character is facing will punch, while attacking in the opposite direction will perform a rear kick. Jumping, followed immediately by one of the attack buttons, which will perform a jumping kick in the direction of the attack. \n \nPressing the joystick twice quickly either left or right will cause the player to run, at which point attacking in the direction of the run will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and attacking in the opposite direction will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a downed enemy will make the player sit on top of the enemy, at which point attacking toward the enemy will cause the player to pummel him.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series. \nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. \nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. \nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njd1ea2hjieo9xduirj3.jpg", "width": 1280, "cloudinary_id": "njd1ea2hjieo9xduirj3", "height": 720}], "id": 1814}, {"genres": [12], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q8wngeuvn3pzxzjc7kmb.jpg", "width": 1081, "cloudinary_id": "q8wngeuvn3pzxzjc7kmb", "height": 966}, "id": 54561, "videos": [{"video_id": "9Jhvb4F4ric", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "X2ksFYz5MIQ", "name": "Trailer"}], "name": "Yo-Kai Watch Busters: White Dog Corps"}, {"genres": [12], "name": "Yo-Kai Watch Busters: Moon Rabbit Team", "videos": [{"video_id": "54KpgOqXNq4", "name": "Trailer"}, {"video_id": "URHn7FOC-R8", "name": "Trailer"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nzblexc7q8cqbt9zblvx.jpg", "width": 347, "cloudinary_id": "nzblexc7q8cqbt9zblvx", "height": 278}, "summary": "The third installment of Yo-Kai Watch Busters that was released as a free DLC expansion for both release versions of the game, Red Cat Squad and White Dog Corps.", "id": 54562}, {"genres": [31], "name": "Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mgfyowatq6wjlabszwhi.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "mgfyowatq6wjlabszwhi", "height": 574}, "summary": "Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, released in Japan as Gyakuten Saiban 4, is the fourth video game in the Ace Attorney series. \nApollo Justice is the first game in the series that does not feature Phoenix Wright as the main protagonist, though it is not the first time a different attorney has been playable.
