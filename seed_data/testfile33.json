There were also a number of puzzle sub-games that had to be completed to progress in the game.\n\nThe version for the 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST was similar in nature to the 8-bit Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions, but contained completely different levels to take advantage of the extra power offered by these computers.\n\nThere was also an arcade-only version of RoboCop 2, developed and published in 1991 by Data East (who still held the rights to create arcade games based on the franchise), which allowed up to two players at once (one controlling the original RoboCop, the other controlling a slightly purple-hued clone).

Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the PC Engine with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.\n\nThe player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.\n\nThough the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.\n\nThe controls are mostly unchanged from R-Type, where the 8-way joystick controls the ship's movement, and the shot button fires the ship's main beam. The other button is used to equip or unequip Force; the series' most unusual innovation. Pressing down the shot button causes the blue beam gauge to fill up, and releasing the button causes a wave beam to travel a certain distance depending on the length of time the button was pressed down. If the button is pressed down until the blue gauge is fully charged, a red gauge appears and fills up quickly. Filling up the red gauge causes it to flash blue and red, releasing the shot button at this point shoots an even more powerful beam.\n\nUnlike the normal beam that only travels in a straight line, the newly added Shotgun Laser beam explodes in multiple directions after traveling a short distance. This shot causes heavy damage if the player can target a single enemy with it. However, holding the button down after the gauge is flashing causes the beam to return to the normal transverse beam (the gauge alternates between flashing and returning to the normal state while the button is held down), so the player must release the button at the right timing in order to successfully target enemies. The other newly added beam, the Search Laser, is semi-homing, and can bend at angles up to 45\u00b0.", "id": 6854}, {"genres": [9, 15, 33], "name": "Tetris", "videos": [{"video_id": "wbHdABxSGrk", "name": "Gameplay video"}, {"video_id": "Ql81jI4DpgQ", "name": "Teaser"}, {"video_id": "uRrTA8NqPpQ", "name": "Teaser"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ocrdnzywvyzcjow0jygv.jpg", "width": 223, "cloudinary_id": "ocrdnzywvyzcjow0jygv", "height": 320}, "summary": "Tetris is an electronic puzzle game that was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, while working in the USSR as a computer programmer.

It was one of the earliest Game Boy titles, and was the first military-based game released for the Game Boy. On June 6, 2011, the game was re-released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console system via online distribution.\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis title has two different modes for one or two players. The player has several options to set up in both modes, in order to play in certain ways.\n\nGame-A\nThis mode is very similar to the pencil and paper game, Battleship, however, there is a storyline to it. The storyline follows the player destroying the enemies fleet on the first two levels and then proceeding to the enemies headquarters on the third level. On the third level, the enemy's vessels are replaced with a large runway and tanks.\n\nThere are also additional features that could be toggled to affect gameplay. First is the \"Near Miss\". If this feature is enabled, a shot directly next to a target ship will display a larger splash and play a beeping noise. Next, there are \"Lucky Shots\" which are randomly placed in empty grid squares. The Lucky Shots are split into two types; Black and White. A Black Lucky Shot will launch one missile, but if that missile hit a target ship, then it will instantly destroy that ship and any other ship touching it. A White Lucky Shot launches a silo of either five or nine missiles depending on the original grid size. There is a hindrance in this Lucky Shot, however, because only hits and misses are displayed on the players radar. If any of the salvo are Near Misses, then the player has to work out where the near misses are. Lastly, there is also an option which allows non-sunk aircraft carriers to launch an airplane mid-game. The airplane is only one square big, but moves around the aircraft carrier between turns.\n\nGame-B\nThis mode allows the player to set up his submarine with extra Prop Speed, shoot Twin Shots, and/or equip a Power Sonar, before battling against other ships. The player moves left or right slowly when above the ocean, while he moves faster when submerged. Players use the radar to locate their enemies and allies only when submerged. They can use the B-button to attack the enemy's submarine with a machine gun, while the player uses the A-button to send out torpedoes at all ships. When the player destroys every ship but the enemy's submarine or just destroys the enemy's submarine itself, he wins the game. The enemy's submarine isn't the only one that can attack and destroy the player in this mode, but also fighter jets take off from aircraft carriers, while dropping torpedoes at the player. Different animated endings pop up, depending on how much the player actually scores in the game.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jtqztguuxwc0etn1denx.jpg", "width": 543, "cloudinary_id": "jtqztguuxwc0etn1denx", "height": 236}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mkjfnzwkipmw58kamyvz.jpg", "width": 265, "cloudinary_id": "mkjfnzwkipmw58kamyvz", "height": 237}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e0uenkndkdxkxfhp02je.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "e0uenkndkdxkxfhp02je", "height": 360}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s3hyk8c8yxyhxazsl7h7.jpg", "width": 330, "cloudinary_id": "s3hyk8c8yxyhxazsl7h7", "height": 298}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fxfynoso93rnarazbeaf.jpg", "width": 315, "cloudinary_id": "fxfynoso93rnarazbeaf", "height": 285}], "id": 11688}, {"genres": [10], "name": "F-1 Race", "videos": [{"video_id": "fSdsgONO6HU", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tvf5p9mrhxmhjc7jmvvs.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "tvf5p9mrhxmhjc7jmvvs", "height": 357}, "summary": "F-1 Race (F1\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9 F1 R\u0113su?) is a racing video game released in 1984 for the Family Computer in Japan.

In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.\n\nGameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \"LOW\" setting and a \"HI\" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on \"skill level 1\" while novices get some extra challenge on \"skill level 2\" and experts get the ultimate challenge on \"skill level 3. A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.\n\nSeveral Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally.

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.\nThe game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.\nThe release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).", "storyline": "NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, is one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and is also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.\nA key feature of NBA Jam is the exaggerated nature of the play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes \"on fire\" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The \"on fire\" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is \"on fire\" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while \"on fire.\"\nThe game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller would activate \"Super Clean Floors\". This feature would cause characters to fall if they ran too fast or changed direction too quickly. And players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden 'tank' game that allows the player to run around a 3D wireframe field. In order to access this mode, however, the player must be able to toggle the on/off switch located behind the machine. While the game was powering back on, the player holds Up and all buttons on player 1 and Down and all buttons on player 2.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/atj4owuxcm4bfbsqiqqc.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "atj4owuxcm4bfbsqiqqc", "height": 480}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xrvkfismfh3aabwakac0.jpg", "width": 609, "cloudinary_id": "xrvkfismfh3aabwakac0", "height": 480}], "id": 8995}, {"genres": [14], "name": "FIFA International Soccer", "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z2klqpsumaso8dudtlhi.jpg", "width": 1483, "cloudinary_id": "z2klqpsumaso8dudtlhi", "height": 2100}, "summary": "Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are.

As in the previous games, it has a cast of characters that players choose from and guide through a series of battles against other opponents. The game avoids the tournament storyline of its predecessors, as various warriors instead fight against the returning Shao Kahn, who has resurrected his bride Sindel and started an invasion of Earthrealm.\nThe third installment of Mortal Kombat retains the blood and gory attacks that defined the series. It introduces new types of the Fatality finishing moves, including Animalities. Other features new to the series were combos, predefined sequences used to perform a series of consecutive attacks. A \"Run\" button was also added, allowing players to briefly dash toward the opponent, as were \"Kombat Kodes\", an unlockable content system using various symbols that can be entered before two-player matches to achieve certain effects.\nSome characters from the previous games returned and new characters were introduced into the series. Mortal Kombat 3 notably omitted popular characters from previous games, some of whom were added in an update, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, released later in 1995. The PC and home console-exclusive Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996) added even more characters, as well as other new features.", "storyline": "Mortal Kombat 3 builds further on the gameplay of the previous game. A \"Run\" button, accompanied by a \"Run\" meter, was introduced. This was primarily to address concern from fans who thought that the previous games gave too much of an advantage to the defending player. The Run meter is drained by running (the character cannot run backwards, only forwards) and by performing combos.\n\"Chain combos\", also known as pre-programmed combos (labeled \"dial-a-combos\") were also introduced. Chain combos are button sequences that cannot be interrupted once one hit connects; some chain combos end with an uppercut or other move that knocks the opponent into the air, so that more damage can be dealt via a traditional juggle combo. To please players of various skill levels, a \"Choose Your Destiny\" screen appears in the single player mode to allow player-selectable difficulty.\nFor the first time, certain levels were interactive by allowing characters to uppercut each other through the ceiling where both characters would continue the battle in a different stage. This could alter the game's level cycle. Both normal uppercuts and uppercuts that are part of a ground combo would result in a level change. Kung Lao's \"Whirl Wind Spin\" move would also have the same effect. However, if the character is defeated by an uppercut, there is no level change.\nAll of the different styles of finishing moves featured in Mortal Kombat II (Fatalities, including the non-lethal Babality and Friendship moves) return in MK3. Additionally, the rumored Animality, where the character transforms into an animal in order to kill their opponent, is featured for the first time. Another new addition is the Mercy, where the character can give their opponent a small sliver of life if they have won two rounds and are at the \"Finish Him/Her\" screen. A Mercy is necessary for an Animality to occur. Finally, three new Stage Fatalities can be performed in the Subway, the Bell Tower and the Pit 3.\nAnother concept introduced in this game is the \"Kombat Kode\". A Kombat Kode is a six-symbol code entered at the VS screen in a two-player game to modify gameplay, fight hidden characters or display certain text messages. Also introduced in this game was the \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\", a 10-character code using symbols, that could be entered on the game over screen after the continue screen disappears in single player mode. It was used to unlock a robotic version of the character Smoke; it can be done by either the player or the arcade operator. The arcade owner could reset this code by accessing the game's diagnostic menu by toggling a DIP switch within the MK3 cabinet. The codes were revealed through gaming magazines, promotional material and other Mortal Kombat media.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z7xmewnxmqha3ewssav6.jpg", "width": 480, "cloudinary_id": "z7xmewnxmqha3ewssav6", "height": 360}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i7mu9gd0zvij2ldwjw4t.jpg", "width": 400, "cloudinary_id": "i7mu9gd0zvij2ldwjw4t", "height": 300}], "id": 1620}, {"genres": [9], "name": "Yoshi's Cookie", "videos": [{"video_id": "VZD9tdJb92k", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frtg9tiifgat9zndnxvo.jpg", "width": 556, "cloudinary_id": "frtg9tiifgat9zndnxvo", "height": 769}, "summary": "Yoshi's Cookie (\u30e8\u30c3\u30b7\u30fc\u306e\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc Yossh\u012b no Kukk\u012b?) is a 1992 tile-matching puzzle video game developed by Bullet-Proof Software for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, and Super NES video game consoles.

During the game, the player-character may grapple onto ledges, climb ladders, crawl, and jump in any direction. The player can also push large crates in order to reach higher platforms.

The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house.\n\nThe game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.\n\nControlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.\n\nDelivering the papers\nThe paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy's speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber's mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber's doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing 'Middle Road', and x3 for playing 'Hard Way'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses.\n\n\nIn Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street.\nThe primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers.\n\nKeeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer's newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer's home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged.\n\nThe player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be \"smacked\" with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life.\n\nThere are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, \"%#@*!\" and \"SMACK!\" The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees.\n\nAlong the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots.\n\nA 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a 'Perfect Delivery' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still awarded, but no further subscribers are added.\n\n\nTraining course\nPaperboy encountering some obstacles, such as a Big Wheel tricyclist and a construction worker.\nThe end of each level contains a \"training course\", with unique music, which the player can traverse within an allotted time for bonus points. In the training course are various targets to be struck with papers, jumps, water and other hazards. Riding over a jump replenishes the paperboy's stock of papers in addition to earning points. As with the rest of the level, the difficulty of the training course increases over the week, with new hazards added each day. Crashing on the course or running out of time ends the day, but does not result in the loss of a life. Successful completion of the training course rewards the player with a bonus for any remaining time.\n\n\nFinish line bug\nA bug in the game allowed the player to skirt the finish line at the end of the training course and repeat it a second time, with garbage data appearing in the display, garnering huge scores.\n\nRecapping the delivery\nThe next day begins with the neighborhood overview again, highlighting new subscribers and any unsubscribers. A flawless delivery record for the previous day results in a new subscriber. The next day through, the street is harder with more obstacles and faster cars.\n\nThe game concludes with the Sunday delivery. The road is the hardest version of whichever road the player has selected, and the Sunday edition papers are heavier and fly more slowly. Successfully delivering papers on this day ends the game, but with a newspaper headlined \"Paperboy Wins Award For Outstanding Paper Delivery\", complete with a picture of the paperboy holding a trophy.\n\nLosing all lives also ends the game with a headline reading \"Paperboy Calls It Quits.\" Causing all subscribers to cancel their subscriptions by either failing to deliver their paper or vandalizing their houses results in a headline reading \"Paperboy Fired\", along with a digitized voice which states \"You're fired!\"\n\nThe arcade version of the game included a number of voice clips, used both as voiceover commentary at game start (e.g. \"Paperboy... stopping at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism,\") and as the voice of the paperboy himself when tossing a paper into a mailbox (e.g. \"Now you have a friend in the paper business.\") or losing a life (e.g. \"I live a life of danger.\"). Hitting a few particular obstacles could trigger voice clips specific to the obstacle. (For example, a satirical \"Let's see you hang ten!\" when struck by a skateboarder, or when struck by a tricyclist, he replies, \"I hate that kid.\") Voice clips from collisions only result from the \"SMACK!\" kind.\n\n\nPORTS:\nPaperboy was ported to consoles and home computers, starting in 1986. In some of these versions, the player could assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron (by Andy Williams, 1986), Commodore 64 (by Chris Harvey and Neil A Bate, 1986), Commodore 16 (1986), Amstrad CPC (1986), ZX Spectrum (1986), Apple II (1986), TRS-80 Color Computer (1986), DOS (1988), Apple IIGS (1988), NES/Famicom (1988)(1991, Japan), Game Boy (1990), Game Boy Color (1999), Atari ST (1989), Amiga (1989), Atari Lynx (1990), Sega Master System (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1991)(1992, Japan). The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States.\n\nUnlike the arcade version, several of these versions inspired a sequel, Paperboy 2 for several home systems (Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, NES, SNES, ZX Spectrum), and a 3D version for the Nintendo 64 called Paperboy 64.\n\nMore recently, Paperboy was included in Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, and Windows released in 2003.\nA Mobile version of Paperboy was released in 2005.\n\nPaperboy was also released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360; however, the game was delisted.\n\nAn iPhone/iPod Touch 25th anniversary version of Paperboy was released December 18, 2009.", "screenshots": [{"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s29dx0vdizqqbw5vpxbl.jpg", "width": 512, "cloudinary_id": "s29dx0vdizqqbw5vpxbl", "height": 384}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hz9edpqsrkywr9ci1b4y.jpg", "width": 512, "cloudinary_id": "hz9edpqsrkywr9ci1b4y", "height": 384}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/idugnjxjvjttyane7bhl.jpg", "width": 1440, "cloudinary_id": "idugnjxjvjttyane7bhl", "height": 1080}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pvgwxx6im9gxwopvrtr7.jpg", "width": 640, "cloudinary_id": "pvgwxx6im9gxwopvrtr7", "height": 448}, {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nsoegta4imoyaeztqif4.jpg", "width": 259, "cloudinary_id": "nsoegta4imoyaeztqif4", "height": 194}], "id": 11762}, {"genres": [5, 33], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kgphjj73bg95djm2lpm4.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "kgphjj73bg95djm2lpm4", "height": 1401}, "id": 26028, "name": "Dropzone"}, {"genres": [8, 33], "name": "Bomb Jack", "videos": [{"video_id": "OgKRNh7PV0k", "name": "Gameplay video"}], "cover": {"url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ctxvgvfolquy1gshohrl.jpg", "width": 1000, "cloudinary_id": "ctxvgvfolquy1gshohrl", "height": 1380}, "summary": "The player controls Jack, a superhero who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at famous tourist sites (the Sphinx and Great Pyramids, the Acropolis, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, and two cityscapes resembling Miami Beach and Hollywood, which appear only as screen backgrounds rather than unique game locations). Jack must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Jack may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty. \n \n \n \nBomb Jack's arcade version \nJack \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Jack may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups. \n \nBomb Bonuses are triggered when Jack touches the first of 24 onscreen bombs. It is possible to collect the remaining bombs in fuse order, the maximum being 23 (the top score possible on a level). Expert players would combine this with X5 'b's for the largest multiplier score available. \n \nThe lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode, although the onscreen enemies become faster the longer Jack is flying around and they eventually start to follow him at speed. At this point, new enemies appear in the form of flying saucers, that 'lock on' to Jack and are difficult to avoid. \n \nEnemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing \"P\" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game.

Other new features included the enemy \"It\", which upon contact would make a player \"It\" and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy. \n \nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits. \n \nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don't be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first).

Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen is three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet uses an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.", "id": 6789}]
